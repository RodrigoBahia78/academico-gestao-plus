Structure Your Figma Design

For smooth exporting, your Figma file needs to be well-organized. Here‚Äôs how to prepare:

#### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/figma-to-lovable\#use-auto-layout-required-for-precise-mode)  Use Auto-Layout (Required for Precise Mode)

- Apply Auto-Layout to all parent containers.
- Use proper **padding, spacing, and resizing** rules.
- Set horizontal/vertical resizing for responsive layouts.

#### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/figma-to-lovable\#name-your-layers-clearly)  Name Your Layers Clearly

- Use names like `Header`, `CTA Button`, `Nav Bar`‚Äînot `Frame 23`.
- Avoid symbols and nested clutter.
- Group similar components logically.

#### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/figma-to-lovable\#build-reusable-components)  Build Reusable Components

- Use consistent styling (fonts, colors, etc.).
- Turn repeated elements into **Figma components**.

#### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/figma-to-lovable\#think-in-design-systems)  Think in Design Systems

- Apply global styles.
- Use a shared component library if available.

**Pro Tip:** [Builder.io](http://builder.io/) supports two export modes:

- **Easy Mode:** Quick, lower fidelity.
- **Precise Mode:** Requires structure but offers pixel-perfect results.

2

Open Builder.io Plugin in Figma

Launched

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/launched\#lovable-lauched)  Lovable Lauched

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lovable-f9060f1e/images/LovableLaunchedfromFigma.png)

We also built a platform, similar to Product Hunt, called [**Lovable Launched**](https://launched.lovable.dev/) where you can publish your app to get in front of thousands of people.

1

Publish Your App on Lovable Launched

The first easy thing you can do is to submit your app to [**Lovable Launched**](https://launched.lovable.dev/) so others can discover and vote on it. The more engagement you get, the higher your visibility on the platform.

Every week and/or month, we give shoutouts to the top-voted projects on **X (Twitter)**. Getting a high number of upvotes can lead to significant traffic to your app.

2

Drive Upvotes & Engagement

An amazing way to get first users is through social media:

- **Post on Social Media:** Share your app and launch on **X (Twitter), LinkedIn, and other platforms**. If you tag @lovable\_dev on X we will usually repost and help amplify your reach.
- **Ask for Support:** Encourage your network ‚Äî friends, colleagues, and online communities ‚Äî to upvote your project on Lovable Launched.
- **Include a Direct Link:** We recommend including a **direct link** to your Lovable Launched page in your posts to make it easy for people to vote.

3

Launch on Product Hunt

If you‚Äôre launching on Lovable Launched, consider launching on **Product Hunt** as well. Product Hunt can give you a lot of traffic if you manage to get to the top of the day.

No matter which strategy you use, **launching on [**Lovable Launched**](https://launched.lovable.dev/) is recommended**. It‚Äôs free, helps you get exposure, and can snowball into bigger opportunities. Good luck!

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/launched\#best-practices)  Best practices

Launching a product is exciting‚Äîbut getting people to actually use it? That‚Äôs the real challenge. Whether you‚Äôre rolling out a side project, a SaaS tool, or a community-driven app, your **first 100 users** set the foundation for everything that follows. This isn‚Äôt about magic hacks or vanity metrics. It‚Äôs about practical, low-cost strategies to get real users who care about what you‚Äôre building.

Tap Into Existing Networks

Your first users are likely in communities you‚Äôre already part of‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs a Slack group, a subreddit, or a personal Twitter following. Instead of spamming, be genuinely helpful and mention your product when relevant.

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/launched\#where-to-start%3A)  Where to Start:

- **Identify personal connections** (friends, colleagues, acquaintances) who might benefit from your product.
- **Engage in online communities** relevant to your product‚Äôs niche (e.g., Reddit, Indie Hackers, Discord groups).
- **Participate** authentically, offering value before mentioning your product.
- **Find relevant industry groups** in Slack, Twitch or Telegram and engage authentically.

üëâ \[Example\] If you‚Äôre launching a dev tool, start by helping people in **r/webdev** or **r/programming** and mention your tool naturally when it fits.

üß∞ [Gummysearch](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/launched), [Casixty](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/launched), [Discord](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/launched)

Validate Ideas and Continuously Test

Before going all in, **validate demand and optimize conversion rates**.

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/launched\#where-to-start%3A-2)  Where to Start:

- **Develop a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** to test with early users and gather feedback.
- **Conduct A/B testing** on different aspects of your product and marketing strategies to determine what resonates best.
- **Analyze data** to make informed decisions and iterate on your product or approach accordingly.

üëâ \[Example\] A startup tested two landing pages: One focused on **features**, the other on **user pain points**. The pain-point-focused page had **3x better conversion.**

üß∞ [Lovable](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/launched), [PostHog](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/launched), [Plausible](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/launched)

Content Marketing & SEO

People search for solutions every day. If you can create content that solves their problems, you‚Äôll get users‚Äîorganically.

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/launched\#where-to-start%3A-3)  Where to Start:

- Create **solution-focused content** (blog posts, tutorials, case studies) addressing your target audience‚Äôs pain points.
- **Optimize content** for long-tail keywords with low competition to improve search engine visibility.
- **Repurpose content** into different formats (e.g., turning a blog post into a video or infographic) to reach a broader audience.

üëâ \[Example\] If you‚Äôre launching a code deployment tool, write **‚ÄúHow to Deploy Your App in 3 Minutes‚Äù**, optimize it for search, and share it in dev communities.

üß∞ [BlogFox](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/launched), [ChatGPT](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/launched), [Ahrefs](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/launched)

Plan and Execute a Strategic Launch

Platforms like **Product Hunt** and [**Lovable Launched**](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/launched) are goldmines for early adopters. They work best when you have a clear audience and a compelling launch message.

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/launched\#where-to-start%3A-4)  Where to Start:

- Prepare a **clear and concise landing page** that effectively communicates your product‚Äôs value proposition.
- **Engage with communities** on platforms like Product Hunt and Lovable Launched prior to your launch to build anticipation.
- **Coordinate** a launch day plan, including announcements in relevant groups, mailing lists, and social media channels.

üëâ \[Example\] A founder launched a simple AI-powered calendar tool and got **500+ upvotes** on Lovable Launched just by engaging with early adopters in startup circles beforehand.

üß∞ [Product Hunt](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/launched), [Lovable Launched](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/launched), [Hacker News](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/launched), [Devto](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/launched), [Indie Hackers](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/launched)

Offer Incentives & Lead Magnets

People love free stuff‚Äîespecially when it‚Äôs valuable. Lead magnets help you build an email list of potential users who actually care about your product.

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/launched\#where-to-start%3A-5)  Where to Start:

- **Develop valuable lead magnets** (e.g., free templates, eBooks) to encourage sign-ups.
- Implement **referral programs** rewarding users for bringing in new customers.
- Provide exclusive beta access or early-bird discounts to create **a sense of urgency** and exclusivity.

üëâ \[Example\] Dropbox famously used a **double-sided referral program**, which helped them grow from **100K to 4M users in 15 months**.

üß∞ [Google Search Console](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/launched)

Use Social Media (the Right Way)

Posting about your launch once won‚Äôt cut it. Instead, create value-driven content that naturally attracts attention.

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/launched\#where-to-start%3A-6)  Where to Start:

- **Share engaging content** on platforms like Twitter, LinkedIn, TikTok, or Instagram, tailored to your audience. Use videos to showcase product use cases creatively.
- **Interact** with followers by responding to comments and messages promptly.
- **Join and contribute** to groups and discussions where your target audience is active.

üëâ \[Example\] Instead of just tweeting ‚ÄúWe launched!‚Äù, share a story: **‚ÄúWe built this to solve \[problem\]‚Äîhere‚Äôs why it‚Äôs different.‚Äù**

üß∞ [Youtube](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/launched), [X, LinedIn](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/launched)

Cold Outreach (When Done Right)

Reaching out to potential users directly can work‚Äîif you personalize it and avoid sounding salesy.

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/launched\#where-to-start%3A-7)  Where to Start:

- **Identify potential users** through platforms like LinkedIn, Twitter (X), or industry-specific forums.
- Craft **personalized, short, non-spammy** messages that address specific needs or challenges of the recipient.
- **Offer value upfront**, such as exclusive access or personalized demos, without being overly promotional.

üëâ \[Example\] Instead of ‚ÄúHey, check out my tool!‚Äù, say **‚ÄúI saw you posted about struggling with X. We built something that might help‚Äîwant early access?‚Äù**

üß∞ [Clay](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/launched), [n8n](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/launched), [Lemlist](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/launched)

Collaborate with Niche Influencers

Find micro-influencers who already talk to your target audience and partner with them.

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/launched\#where-to-start%3A-8)  Where to Start:

- **Research and identify micro-influencers** whose audience aligns with your target market. Look for YouTubers, bloggers, and Twitter creators in your space.
- Propose **mutually beneficial partnerships**, such as offering free access in exchange for honest reviews or mentions.
- Ensure collaborations are **authentic** and provide real value to the influencer‚Äôs audience.
- Sponsor content if budget allows (but focus on genuine partnerships).

üëâ \[Example\] If you‚Äôre launching a design tool, partner with small UX YouTubers for an honest review.

üß∞ [Youtube](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/launched), [X](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/launched)

Consider Paid Acquisition (As a Last Resort)

While organic methods are cost-effective and build a loyal user base, there might come a time when you consider paid acquisition to scale your efforts. However, it‚Äôs essential to approach this cautiously to ensure a positive return on investment (ROI).

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/launched\#where-to-start%3A-9)  **Where to Start:**

- **Set a modest budget:** Begin with a small budget to test the waters without significant financial risk.
- **Target specific audiences:** Use platforms like Google Ads or Facebook Ads to reach users who fit your ideal customer profile.
- **Monitor and adjust:** Regularly track the performance of your ads. If certain campaigns aren‚Äôt delivering results, tweak or discontinue them.
- **Optimize landing pages:** Ensure that the pages users land on are compelling and relevant, increasing the chances of conversion.

Remember, while paid acquisition can provide a quick influx of users, it‚Äôs crucial to balance it with organic strategies to build a sustainable and engaged community.

üß∞ [Google Ads](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/launched), [Reddits Ads](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/launched)

What‚Äôs next?

Congratulations on reaching your first milestone of acquiring 100 users! This achievement validates your MVP‚Äôs value and its ability to address real user needs. Now, it‚Äôs time to scale up. By continuously iterating and enhancing your product based on user feedback, the journey to your next 1,000 users will unfold naturally. Keep focusing on delivering value, and success will follow.

- **Deepen User Engagement:** Engage directly with your initial users to gather feedback and foster a community for sharing insights.
- **Expand Your Reach:** Identify potential users through personalized outreach and collaborate with influencers to increase visibility.
- **Enhance Product Value:** Continuously refine your product based on user feedback and introduce unique features that differentiate your offering.
- **Leverage Content and SEO:** Produce content addressing your audience‚Äôs pain points and optimize it with relevant keywords for better search rankings.
- **Implement Referral Programs:** Encourage existing users to refer others by offering incentives.

Getting your first 100 users isn‚Äôt about luck‚Äîit‚Äôs about being intentional with your approach. Start with what‚Äôs free and available: existing networks, community engagement, content, and targeted outreach. **Test what works, double down, and iterate.**

Features

Modes

At Lovable, you can work with AI in two powerful modes:

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/modes\#1-edit-mode)  1\. Edit Mode

**Edit Mode** is your AI developer. It writes code, adds new features, and updates your project‚Äîautomatically. This is the default mode when you start using Lovable.

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/modes\#2-chat-mode)  2\. Chat Mode

**Chat Mode** is your development partner and is **10x smarter**. It helps you think through problems, debug issues, and plan your product‚Äîdirectly within the Lovable Editor.

Unlike Edit Mode, Chat Mode is conversational and doesn‚Äôt make edits to the code. This is perfect for asking questions, planning your project, and debugging. This mode is agentic, meaning it can reason across multiple steps and decide when to search files, inspect logs, query the database, and more. Then, when you‚Äôre ready, simply prompt: ‚Äú `Implement the plan`‚Äù.

This switches you back to Edit Mode, where Lovable turns those ideas into working code.

Because these capabilities come with additional costs, messages in Chat Mode will now start counting towards your message limit.

Tips & tricks

Using npm packages

While Lovable is powerful on its own, enabling users to build sophisticated web applications, you can leverage npm packages for more advanced and extended features. These packages help you build even more complex and feature-rich applications with ease.

**What is npm?**

npm (Node Package Manager) is a package manager for JavaScript that allows developers to share and reuse code. It hosts thousands of packages, which are pieces of reusable code, that you can easily integrate into your projects to extend functionality.

You can access it [at npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/).

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/npm-packages\#using-npm-packages-for-advanced-features)  Using npm packages for advanced features

Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôd like to create a tool that enables you to arrange your tasks in different Kanban boards, similar to many popular project management tools. You can prompt Lovable to build this tool from scratch, but it might be slower and more challenging to achieve the desired functionality.

Instead, you can use npm packages to simplify and speed up the process. For example, the [@hello-pangea/dnd](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hello-pangea/dnd) package provides robust drag-and-drop functionality. By using this package, you can easily create a Kanban board where users can add new cards, move them within columns, and reorder them.

Example prompt

Copy

```
Use the hello-pangea/dnd npm package to add drag-and-drop functionality to my Kanban board app.
Ensure users can add new cards, move them within columns, and reorder them.
```

This prompt directs Lovable to integrate the package into your project, making it easier to achieve the desired functionality. Depending on other requirements, your result might look somewhat like this.

![Lovable implemented drag-and-drop Kanban functionality](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lovable-f9060f1e/assets/npm-example-using-pangea-dnd.png)

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/npm-packages\#quality-and-responsibility)  Quality and responsibility

It‚Äôs important to note that while npm packages can significantly enhance your projects, Lovable cannot guarantee the quality or reliability of these third-party packages.

The functionality and performance of npm packages are the responsibility of the end user, and it‚Äôs essential to thoroughly test and validate them within your application.

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/npm-packages\#increasing-your-chances-of-success)  Increasing your chances of success

Here are a few strategies to help you evaluate the legitimacy and quality of npm packages before integrating them into your projects.

- **Number of downloads** \- Check the number of downloads on the package‚Äôs npm page. A high number of downloads typically indicates that the package is widely used and trusted by the community.

- **Maintenance status and latest updates** \- Look at the package‚Äôs repository to see if it is actively maintained. Frequent commits, recent updates, and responsiveness to issues are good indicators of an actively maintained package. Ensure the package has recent updates. A package that is regularly updated is more likely to be compatible with the latest versions of dependencies and security practices.

- **Reviews and community feedback** \- A lot of npm packages are hosted on GitHub or similar code repositories. Read through reviews, discussions, and feedback from other developers on those locations, too. Additionally, specific developer forums can provide insights into the package‚Äôs reliability and any potential issues.

Security

# [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/security\#api-keys)  API keys

Lovable writes frontend code, which means it runs in the browser. Therefore, no sensitive data of any kind should be stored in code.

To connect to third party services (like OpenAI, Anthropic etc), API keys are needed. We recommend you use Supabase secrets to store your API keys, in combination with the [Supabase Edge Functions](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/supabase#edge-functions).

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/security\#automatic-api-key-detection)  Automatic API key detection

Whenever you paste an API key into the chat, Lovable will automatically detect it and warn you not to hardcode sensitive credentials directly into your frontend code. Instead of pasting API keys, describe what you‚Äôre trying to accomplish and Lovable will guide you through the secure implementation.

![Screenshot 2025-05-30 at 09.21.22.png](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lovable-f9060f1e/images/Screenshot2025-05-30at09.21.22.png)

For example, instead of:

‚ÄúAdd this API key to call OpenAI: sk\_test\_abc123‚Ä¶‚Äù

Try this:

‚ÄúI want to integrate OpenAI‚Äôs API to generate text responses‚Äù

Lovable will then show you how to:

1. Store your API key securely in Supabase secrets.

2. Create a Supabase Edge Function to make the API call server-side.

3. Call that Edge Function from your frontend code.


This approach keeps your sensitive credentials secure and follows security best practices for web applications.

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/security\#supabase-rls)  Supabase RLS

RLS policies determine who can access what data in your Supabase database. We recommend you carefully review them before publishing your project.

# [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/security\#security-scanning)  Security scanning

Before publishing, Lovable displays security warnings from the [Supabase security advisor](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/database-advisors?queryGroups=lint&lint=0002_auth_users_exposed) and will ask you to confirm that you want to publish if there are any warnings.

We highly recommend you resolve all issues before publishing your projects and to keep your app‚Äôs data safe.

Seeing no warnings or errors from the Supabase security advisor does not guarantee that there are no security issues in your app. We recommend you ask Lovable to review your app‚Äôs security before publishing.

# [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/security\#security-scanning-2)  Security scanning

Lovable includes comprehensive AI-powered security scanning to help identify potential vulnerabilities in your code before you publish.

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/security\#enhanced-rls-policy-review)  Enhanced RLS policy review

The Supabase security advisor can sometimes miss incorrect RLS (Row Level Security) usage. To address this, Lovable includes a deep code security review that uses AI to analyze your app for potential security issues beyond what Supabase‚Äôs built-in advisor catches. This provides additional coverage for RLS policy problems and suggests specific plans on how to fix them.

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/security\#manual-security-review)  Manual security review

You can request a security review at any time by asking Lovable to ‚Äúreview my app‚Äôs security‚Äù or clicking the ‚ÄúReview Security‚Äù button in the publish dialog.

Lovable will:

1. Analyze your entire codebase for security vulnerabilities
2. Check for common issues like XSS prevention, input sanitization, and authentication flaws
3. Review your Supabase RLS policies and database security (going deeper than Supabase‚Äôs own advisor)
4. Provide a detailed report with specific recommendations

![Screenshot 2025-05-30 at 09.30.34.png](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lovable-f9060f1e/images/Screenshot2025-05-30at09.30.34.png)

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/security\#pre-publish-security-checks)  Pre-publish security checks

Before publishing, Lovable automatically displays security warnings from both the Supabase security advisor and its own enhanced AI security scanner. You‚Äôll be asked to confirm if there are any warnings, though we highly recommend resolving all issues first.

![Screenshot 2025-05-30 at 09.49.21.png](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lovable-f9060f1e/images/Screenshot2025-05-30at09.49.21.png)

Remember: Even with no warnings, always request a manual security review for production applications.

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/visual-edit\#why-it-matters)  Why It Matters

Visual Edits shortens the feedback loop between **idea ‚Üí UI update**:

- **No-code meets pro-level control**


Designers get pixel-perfect control, and devs get clean, maintainable code.
- **Faster iteration, zero frustration**


No more guessing how CSS will behave‚Äîsee it live, tweak in real-time.
- **Hot Module Reloading**


Thanks to Vite-powered Dev Servers, saved edits refresh instantly‚Äîwithout page reloads.
- **Smarter Editing with AST**


Behind the scenes, your code is converted into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) right in the browser. This allows safe, precise updates‚Äîno fragile regex hacks.
- **Scalable Infrastructure**


Every Visual Edit runs on ephemeral, containerized cloud dev servers‚Äî4,000+ of them‚Äîso your experience stays fast and consistent no matter your app‚Äôs complexity.
- **Tailwind-native**


Whether you‚Äôre using presets or writing your own classes, edits are always valid Tailwind. No locked-in styles.

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/visual-edit\#common-use-cases)  Common Use Cases

- Change button colors or font weights on the fly.
- Resize and align layout elements visually.
- Rewrite CTA copy inline.
- Add Tailwind classes to fine-tune spacing, shadows, borders, and more.
- Preview edits across breakpoints and themes instantly.

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/visual-edit\#under-the-hood-for-devs)  Under the Hood (for devs)

We built Visual Edits by moving the code layer closer to the visual layer:

- **Stable JSX Tagging**


Every generated component is tagged at compile-time using a custom Vite plugin, so edits map directly back to JSX source.
- **In-browser AST**


The full codebase is parsed into an interactive AST client-side using Babel & SWC. This enables live updates and custom class handling‚Äîall without waiting on servers.
- **Live Tailwind Generator**


Changes reflect immediately with our real-time Tailwind parser. You see the update before you save it.
- **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**


When you do save, we generate clean JSX/TSX, compute diffs, and instantly trigger HMR to update the app.

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/visual-edit\#built-for-everyone)  Built for Everyone

Whether you‚Äôre:

- A **non-technical founder** making your product shine
- A **designer** refining spacing and hierarchy
- A **developer** polishing the details with real-time feedback

Visual Edits fits right into your workflow.

Integrations

Integrate with 21st.dev

Most AI-generated landing pages look the same‚Äîvague sections, off-brand colors, and no personality. But it doesn‚Äôt have to be that way.

We are going to share a structured workflow using Lovable and 21stdev that creates landing pages clients _actually_ love (like [this one](https://lovable.dev/projects/35d72d2e-6e25-40e5-9b0c-c0d1a7c1b727)).

![Hero Section Landing Page](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lovable-f9060f1e/images/hero-section.png)

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/21stdev-integration\#step-by-step-guide)  Step-by-step guide

From design inspiration to final polish, here‚Äôs the step-by-step guide he uses to build fast without sacrificing quality:

1

Start with Design Inspiration, Not a Prompt

Before writing a single word of prompt, browse [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/) or [Behance](https://www.behance.net/). Look for designs with:

- Clean typography and spacing
- Clear CTAs and minimal layout
- Subtle interactions (not overdesigned)

Pick something you can realistically replicate. Avoid overly complex 3D designs if you don‚Äôt plan to recreate them.

A real client asked for a ‚Äúmodern and minimal‚Äù design. That informed the visual starting point. Avoid picking something you can‚Äôt deliver.

2

Start with a blank project

Start your Lovable project by prompting:

Start with a blank empty project. We will be adding details afterwords.

3

Convert WebP to PNG and Prep Your Design Screenshot

Once you find your reference design, download it. If it saves in WebP format, use an online converter to change it to PNG so it can be easily used in Lovable or GPT workflows.

Tools we recommend: [https://cloudconvert.com/webp-to-png](https://cloudconvert.com/webp-to-png)

4

Turn Inspiration into a Detailed Prompt Using Chat Mode

Use Lovable [Chat Mode](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/labs#chat-mode) to extract:

- Page sections (hero, features, FAQ, etc.)
- Layout structure, spacing, and content order
- Font families, color palettes, and gradients
- Animation types, hover effects, and transitions

Lovable [Chat mode](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/labs#chat-mode) (or customGPT) is also trained to recommend Unsplash images for blog thumbnails and illustrations.

Lovable occasionally mislabels things (e.g., ‚ÄúSpace Grotesque‚Äù font was misspelled). Always review and correct prompt outputs before pasting into Lovable.

You can even ask Lovable chat mode to elaborate on sections or rewrite the prompt with better UX suggestions.

5

Generate the First Draft with Lovable

Paste the detailed prompt into Lovable Edit Mode. Then:

- Upload your PNG screenshot as a reference
- Add notes like ‚Äú _Use Space Grotesque font_‚Äù or ‚ÄúUse Unsplash for blog thumbnails‚Äù

This combo leads to far more accurate designs than vague, single-sentence prompts.

Please note how much Lovable faster this feels compared to setting up Tailwind or Bootstrap manually just a year ago.

6

Edit in Real Time: Visual + Text Prompts

Use Lovable‚Äôs [visual editing tool](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/visual-edit) to:

- Resize images (e.g., ‚Äúmake this image 800px wide‚Äù)
- Position hero images (e.g., ‚Äúplace this image on the right side‚Äù)
- Align design sections with the reference image

Combine this with natural language edits for precision.

7

Polish the Design with 21stdev Components

Use [21stdev](https://21st.dev/)‚Äôs prebuilt UI components to upgrade:

![21stdev custom component ](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lovable-f9060f1e/images/21stdev.png)

- Hero sections
- Navigation bars with hover effects
- Testimonial layouts
- CTAs and feature grids

Find a component you like, copy the prompt, and paste it into Lovable. Be sure to match the visual tone with the rest of the site.

8

Fix AI Misinterpretations

AI saves time, but expect cleanup:

![Add spec component in landing page](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lovable-f9060f1e/images/component.png)

- Adjust branding (Lovable defaults to blue)
- Improve spacing and padding manually
- Use consistent typography throughout
- Add gradients or depth for a non-flat look

Make the design feel _intentional_, not ‚Äúdefault.‚Äù

9

Optimize for Mobile (Non-Negotiable)

Don‚Äôt skip this. Ensure:

![Mobile Responsive website](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lovable-f9060f1e/images/mobile-responsive.png)

- Inputs go full-width
- Font sizes adapt to smaller screens
- Buttons are tap-friendly
- Sections stack well and scroll smoothly

Mobile UX is critical for conversions.

10

Add Light Animations and Microinteractions

To modernize the feel:

- Use fade-ins for hero sections
- Add button hover effects
- Animate sections on scroll
- Use subtle background movement

Lovable can integrate [Framer Motion](https://motion.dev/) out-of-the-box if prompted right.

![Add animation landing page](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lovable-f9060f1e/images/animation.png)

11

Generate Custom Visuals with AI (Optional)

Craft prompts for ChatGPT, Midjourney or Ideogram based on your favorite elements from the reference design.

**Steps:**

1

Screenshot the desired visual section

2

Ask ChatGPT to write a matching prompt

3

Generate the image in your AI tool

4

Remove the background, then reinsert into Lovable

The latest ChatGPT 4o seems worth the test.

This is especially useful for 3D visuals or thematic illustrations.

12

Deploy with a Single Click

Once you‚Äôre happy with the result:

- Click ‚ÄúDeploy‚Äù in Lovable
- Connect a custom domain via Netlify

Your site goes live in minutes. No manual setup needed.

13

Share with Clients & Iterate

Copy the public link and share with your client. They can:

- Review it live
- Suggest tweaks
- Approve quickly

You can continue refining sections using Lovable‚Äôs visual or prompt-based editor. It‚Äôs a fast iteration loop.

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/21stdev-integration\#why-this-approach-works%3F)  Why This Approach Works?

AI isn‚Äôt magic. But with structure, it becomes a superpower. Compared to unstructured prompting:

- The first draft is 10x closer to done
- You spend less time fixing errors
- Every section has a purpose
- The final product feels custom, not cookie-cutter

It‚Äôs a blend of automation **+** craftsmanship.

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/21stdev-integration\#key-takeaways)  Key Takeaways

- Start with strong visual inspiration
- Use structured prompts with Lovable Chat Mode
- Add screenshots and clarify expectations
- Upgrade sections using 21stdev components
- Fix design quirks and optimize for mobile
- Animate where it matters
- Deploy fast, iterate faster

This is the workflow [Prajwal](https://x.com/PrajwalTomar_/status/1902371273147064772) uses everyday for his clients - that we tried in-house - to build fast, beautiful, high-converting landing pages‚Äîpowered by Lovable AI but guided by intention.

Happy Building!

Integrations

Integration with AI

Lovable makes it easy to integrate AI services into your web applications. Whether you want to build an AI-powered landing page, a text-generation tool, or a full SaaS app, Lovable‚Äôs built-in integrations with services like [**OpenAI**](https://platform.openai.com/)\*\*, **[**Groq**](https://console.groq.com/keys)**, **[**Claude**](https://www.anthropic.com/api)**, **[**Deepseek**](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/)**, and \*\* [**Mistral**](https://docs.mistral.ai/api/) make it possible without writing backend code. Here‚Äôs how to do it:

1

Choose the AI Feature You Need

Before you start building, define what you want the AI to do:

- Generate or enhance text (e.g. email writer, tweet generator)
- Classify or summarize content
- Analyze images
- Personalize responses
- Integrate with a specific LLM API

2

Plan with Prompts First

Use Lovable‚Äôs chat interface to describe your feature in simple terms. For example:

Copy

```
Build an email enhancement tool. The user should write an email, then click buttons to make it more professional, concise, or friendly using Groq API.
```

Lovable will scaffold the UI, suggest components, and let you preview the app quickly.

3

Connect to a Backend with Supabase

AI features often need backend logic. Supabase provides:

- Database for user data
- Auth for login/signup
- Edge Functions for calling external APIs securely

Set up Supabase early in your project to avoid UI/backend mismatches.

4

Use Edge Functions for AI Calls

To safely call AI APIs, create an Edge Function inside Lovable:

- Add your API key to the Supabase by submitting this via the secrets form
- Let Lovable generate the edge function code
- Ensure you use function calling if your API returns structured data (e.g. calories, macros, tweet threads)

**Prompt Example:**

Copy

```
Use GPT-4 and function calling to extract nutrition info from a meal description. Save the results to the backend.
```

Structure your OpenAI function calling schema with defined fields like:

Copy

```
{
  "name": "extract_nutrition",
  "parameters": {
    "calories": "number",
    "protein": "number",
    "carbs": "number",
    "fat": "number"
  }
}
```

5

Make It Interactive

Add buttons or form actions for:

- Submitting text to the AI
- Uploading an image
- Toggling between modes (concise vs friendly tone)

Lovable lets you:

- Attach functions to buttons
- Animate interactions
- Show real-time results with minimal prompting

Use screenshots and phrases like ‚Äúmake this smoother‚Äù to guide the design.

**Advanced UX Tip:** Implement side-by-side live previews of the AI response. Use left/right layout blocks or tabs to let users compare outputs.

6

Use External Services (Optional)

Some popular integrations for AI workflows:

- **Resend** ‚Äì send emails after form submission
- **Groq API** ‚Äì blazing fast LLM inference
- **Stripe** ‚Äì paywall access to AI tools
- **Replicate** ‚Äì generate or transform images

**Prompt Example:**

Copy

```
When a user submits the contact form, send an email using Resend and store the message in Supabase.
```

**Payments Tip:** Lock advanced AI features behind a Stripe subscription. Use conditional flows like:

Copy

```
if (user.isPaid) { showAIFeature(); } else { redirectToCheckout(); }
```

7

Test and Iterate

- Use preview links to test mobile responsiveness
- Check performance with multiple API calls
- Share your project for feedback
- Use chat history to revert changes or refactor

8

Publish and Promote

When you‚Äôre ready:

- Deploy with a single click
- Use [Lovable Launch](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/launched) to get visibility
- Add OG tags and SEO title/description in the meta panel
- Submit your app to Product Hunt, communities, and social media

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/ai-integration\#debug-and-improve-prompts)  **Debug and Improve Prompts**

- Be specific with system messages: ‚ÄúYou are a helpful nutritionist.‚Äù
- Test function calling by mocking inputs.
- Use `console.log()` inside edge functions to trace logic.
- Use screenshots when asking Lovable to debug a layout.

**Prompt Tip:** If the AI fails to use your context (e.g. user‚Äôs meals), say:

Copy

```
Make sure all of the user's meals are included in the prompt to GPT-4.
```

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/ai-integration\#troubleshooting)  Troubleshooting

Missing data in AI prompts?

Make sure you include context like user history or previous entries.

UI not updating?

Use chat-only mode to debug one step at a time.

Streaming issues with Groq/OpenAI?

Ensure `stream: true` is supported.

Image uploads not working?

Use file inputs and convert to base64 or upload via Supabase Storage.

Edge Function fails silently?

View Edge Function logs in Lovable‚Äôs function editor or Supabase dashboard.

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/clerk\#bonus%3A-build-b2b-features-in-minutes)  Bonus: Build B2B Features in Minutes

Clerk supports:

- Role-based access for organizations
- Invite flows (email-based, pre-built UI)
- Organization profile customization (logo, name)
- Multi-org switching (e.g. Slack-style)

**Ask Lovable to:**

Let users invite teammates

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/clerk\#tips-%26-troubleshooting)  Tips & Troubleshooting

- **Already using Supabase Auth?** You can switch to Clerk without rewriting your app logic. Just configure JWT correctly and swap auth provider.
- **Email customization:** Clerk lets you edit all transactional email templates (waitlist, invitations, approvals).
- **Mobile login**: Clerk supports passkeys, OTP, and SMS ‚Äî no extra config needed in Dev Mode.
- **Compliance**: Clerk is SOC2, HIPAA, and GDPR compliant.

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/clerk\#frequently-asked-questions-faq)  Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

Can I switch from Supabase Auth to Clerk easily?

Yes. Clerk and Supabase work well together. You just need to:

- Set up Clerk to issue JWTs
- Add Supabase‚Äôs JWT secret in Clerk
- Update Supabase RLS policies to use Clerk‚Äôs `auth.uid()`

This lets you plug Clerk into an existing Supabase-backed app with minimal changes.

Do I need to configure OAuth providers like Google or GitHub?

Only for production. In development mode, Clerk provides shared credentials for testing. For production:

- Set up your own Google/GitHub/etc. credentials
- Add them in Clerk under **OAuth settings**

What‚Äôs the difference between Organizations and Users?

- **Users**: Individuals who can log in to your app
- **Organizations**: Groups of users (teams, companies)

Use organizations when you want:

- Role-based access (Admin, Member, etc.)
- Users to invite teammates
- B2B SaaS-style flows

What is ‚ÄúImpersonation Mode‚Äù?

It allows admins to log in as any user ‚Äî super helpful for:

- Debugging user issues

Clerk limits what impersonators can do (e.g., no password changes).

Can I customize Clerk's UI components?

Yes. Clerk offers:

- Full CSS support via `appearance` props
- The option to build fully custom UIs using Clerk React hooks

You can keep the out-of-the-box look or fully match your app‚Äôs brand.

- Bulk email support is **coming soon**

For now, export emails and use your preferred email tool.

Is Clerk free to use?

Yes! Clerk has a generous free tier:

- Up to **10,000 Monthly Active Users (MAUs)**
- Paid plans start at **$25/month**, with usage-based pricing after

You can use it in production without paying until you scale.

Yes. Clerk is:

- **SOC 2 certified**
- **HIPAA-compliant**
- **GDPR-ready**

Ideal for teams building in regulated industries.

Can I use Clerk with Stripe for billing?

GitHub Integration

![Github Lovable integration](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lovable-f9060f1e/images/github-lovable.png)

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/git-integration\#what-is-github)  What is GitHub

Integrating GitHub into your Lovable project ensures you have full version control, collaboration tools, and code portability throughout your app‚Äôs lifecycle.

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/git-integration\#tl%3Bdr%3A)  **TL;DR:**

- **Git** is a version control system that tracks changes in your code.
- **GitHub** is the industry-standard platform for hosting Git repositories and tracking code changes, which makes it essential for both solo builders and teams using Lovable.
- By linking your project to GitHub, every change in your Lovable app is backed up in a Git repository in real time. This means you get a complete history of your code, the ability to collaborate with developers in familiar workflows, and the freedom to host or deploy your app outside of Lovable if needed.
- **GitHub integration** brings transparency, safety, and flexibility to your Lovable development process.

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/git-integration\#key-benefits-of-github-integration%3A)  Key Benefits of GitHub Integration:

Lovable backs every project with a Git repository, making it easy for developers to push commits directly to GitHub. This means:

- **Version History & Backup:** All your code is tracked with Git, so you can review changes or roll back to any previous state. Every commit is saved to GitHub, providing an external backup of your project‚Äã
- **Team Collaboration:** Your code lives on GitHub where others (developers, contributors) can easily view it, comment, and contribute via pull requests‚Äã. Non-technical team members can also see the code history for transparency.
- **Real-Time Sync:** Lovable automatically syncs with your GitHub repo. If you push code to GitHub, Lovable pulls it in almost immediately‚Äã. If you edit code in Lovable, it pushes those changes to GitHub. You‚Äôll always have the latest code in both places without manual copying.
- **Workflow Integration:** Use GitHub‚Äôs tools (branches, pull requests, issues, CI/CD, etc.) alongside Lovable‚Äã. For example, you can run tests or deploy your app via GitHub Actions when code is merged, all while continuing to use Lovable‚Äôs editor and AI to develop features.
- **Deployment Flexibility:** Connecting to GitHub gives you the option to host your app on your own infrastructure or platform of choice. You‚Äôre not locked into Lovable‚Äôs hosting ‚Äì you can export the code and deploy it anywhere‚Äã. (Lovable will still sync changes with GitHub, so you can continue editing in Lovable even if you host the app elsewhere.)

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/git-integration\#connecting-lovable-to-your-github-account-setup-guide)  Connecting Lovable to Your GitHub Account (Setup Guide)

To start using GitHub with Lovable, you need to connect your GitHub account and create a repository for your project. Here‚Äôs how to set it up:

1

Initiate GitHub Connection:

In the Lovable editor, click on **GitHub ‚Üí Connect to GitHub** (usually found in the top-right corner of the project editor)‚Äã. This will begin the authorization process.

2

Authorize Lovable on GitHub:

You‚Äôll be redirected to GitHub to authorize the Lovable GitHub App. Sign in to GitHub if prompted. When asked to grant access, choose either **All repositories** or **Only select repositories** ‚Äã. Granting access to all repos is easiest, but selecting specific repos is fine too ‚Äì either way, Lovable will be able to create a new repo for your project in your account or organization

3

Select GitHub Account/Org

If your GitHub user belongs to organizations, you may need to confirm which GitHub account or organization to install the Lovable app to. You can create the project‚Äôs repo under your personal GitHub or any organization where you have permission.

You can only connect **one** GitHub account per Lovable account at a time‚Äã. If you want to use an organization‚Äôs GitHub, make sure you have admin access in that org to allow repo creation

4

Create the Repository

Once GitHub is connected, return to your Lovable project. Click the **Create Repository** button (located in the top-right of the Lovable editor interface)‚Äã. Lovable will then create a new GitHub repository for this project and push the current project code to that repo. This initial push might take a few seconds. After this step, your Lovable project‚Äôs code is now on GitHub.

5

Verify the Link

GitHub and navigate to your account (or org) ‚Äì you should see the new repository with your project‚Äôs name. It will contain all the code of your Lovable app. In Lovable, you might also see a confirmation or the GitHub repository name linked. From now on, any changes in Lovable will sync to this repo and vice versa.

If you plan to connect multiple Lovable projects to GitHub, you can repeat the above for each project (each will create its own repo). Each Lovable project can have one linked GitHub repo. Remember that your Lovable account remains linked to whichever GitHub login you authorized until you disconnect it. If you ever need to switch the GitHub account, you‚Äôd have to disconnect the current one in your Lovable settings and then connect a new account.

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/git-integration\#how-syncing-works-lovable-%E2%86%94-github)  How Syncing Works (Lovable ‚Üî GitHub)

Once your project is connected to GitHub, Lovable ensures that code changes stay in sync between the Lovable editor and your GitHub repository. The integration is **bidirectional**, but it follows some specific rules and behaviors:

- **Default Branch Sync Only:** Lovable currently tracks **only the default branch** of your GitHub repository‚Äã. This is typically the `main` branch (or `master`, depending on your repo). If you push commits to other branches on GitHub, those changes will **not** appear in your Lovable project until they are merged into the default branch‚Äã. For example, if you‚Äôre working on a `feature/login` branch, Lovable won‚Äôt show those updates in the editor until you merge `feature/login` into `main` on GitHub. Similarly, Lovable will only push its changes to the default branch. Keep this in mind when using multiple branches. (See the FAQ on switching default branch if you need to change which branch Lovable syncs.)
- **Real-Time Updates from GitHub:** When you commit and push code to the default branch on GitHub, those commits will show up in Lovable almost automatically‚Äã. Lovable‚Äôs integration listens for changes ‚Äì whenever you push to GitHub, Lovable pulls the latest commit into the project. You don‚Äôt need to manually refresh or import anything; the editor will reflect the new code typically within a few seconds of the push‚Äã. This allows developers to work in their own environment and see the results in Lovable instantly.
- **Pushing Changes from Lovable:** If you make changes in Lovable (for example, editing code via Lovable‚Äôs Dev Mode or having the AI generate new code), those changes are also saved to the Git repository backing your project. Lovable will push these commits to GitHub automatically, updating the repository. In practice, you can treat Lovable as another git client ‚Äì when the AI or you modify code in the Lovable editor, it‚Äôs as if you committed and pushed to GitHub. For instance, adding a new page or editing a file in Lovable will result in a commit (with the changes) appearing in the GitHub repo‚Äôs commit history. This ensures both Lovable and GitHub always have the same latest code.
- **No Manual Pull/Push Needed:** The sync is continuous. You do not have to manually ‚Äúpull‚Äù updates into Lovable or ‚Äúpush‚Äù updates to GitHub ‚Äì Lovable handles it. Pushing code to GitHub triggers Lovable to fetch the changes, and editing in Lovable triggers a push to GitHub behind the scenes‚Äã. Your focus can be on building, not on syncing. If you ever suspect a change didn‚Äôt sync, a quick refresh of the Lovable editor or checking the GitHub repo can confirm the latest state (but in general it‚Äôs automatic).
- **Conflict Handling:** Because both Lovable and GitHub can change the code, there‚Äôs a chance of a git conflict if changes happen on the same file at the same time. In practice this is rare, but if a conflict does occur, you would resolve it just like any Git conflict. For example, you might need to go to the GitHub repo and manually merge or fix conflicting changes, then commit. Lovable will then pull the resolved code. To avoid conflicts, it‚Äôs best to coordinate who is editing or use branches for larger changes (merging to main when ready).

In summary, the GitHub integration means your Lovable project‚Äôs code and the GitHub repository are effectively one and the same source, mirrored in real time. You can confidently switch between the Lovable editor and other development tools knowing both will stay updated‚Äã

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/git-integration\#importing-an-existing-github-repository-into-lovable)  Importing an Existing GitHub Repository into Lovable

What if you already have a codebase on GitHub and want to use Lovable with it? Currently, **Lovable does not yet support directly importing or linking to an existing external GitHub repo as a new project** ‚Äã. In other words, you can‚Äôt point Lovable at an existing repository and have it pull in all that code automatically (as of now). However, there are ways to bring your existing code into Lovable:

- **Manual Import via a New Repo:** One workaround is to create a new Lovable project and connect it to GitHub (following the setup steps above), which gives you an empty repository (or a repository with the starter code from Lovable). Then, you can **manually add your existing code to that repository**. For example, you could clone the new GitHub repo to your local machine, copy in the files from your old project, commit and push. Once you push your existing code into the repo‚Äôs default branch, Lovable will sync those files and you‚Äôll see them in the Lovable editor. This effectively migrates your code into a Lovable project.
- **Copy-Paste Smaller Snippets:** If your project is small, you might also start a Lovable project and copy code pieces (like individual files or functions) into Lovable via the editor or the AI (for instance, by pasting code into Lovable‚Äôs code editor or prompting the AI with your code). This is less ideal for large projects but can work for minor modules.
- **[Planned Import Feature:](https://feedback.lovable.dev/p/have-the-possibility-to-import-an-existing-github-project)** The Lovable team is aware that direct repo import is a desired feature, and it‚Äôs something under consideration for future updates‚Äã. Keep an eye on Lovable‚Äôs roadmap or announcements for any feature that allows importing an existing repo more directly.

Importing an existing codebase may involve setting up any necessary configuration in Lovable (e.g., environment variables, dependencies) to mirror the original project‚Äôs setup. After you‚Äôve brought in the code, test the project within Lovable to ensure everything runs. From then on, you can use Lovable‚Äôs AI features on your code and still sync back to GitHub.

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/git-integration\#developing-with-github-and-lovable-in-parallel)  Developing with GitHub and Lovable in Parallel

Once connected, you can build and edit your application using GitHub (or your local development environment) and Lovable simultaneously. This is great for developers who want to use their own tools or for teams where some members prefer coding by hand. Here are some ways to work effectively with the integration:

- **Viewing the Repository:** In the Lovable editor, you‚Äôll have an option to view the GitHub repository (often via a **‚ÄúView on GitHub‚Äù** link or button)‚Äã. Clicking this will take you straight to the repository page on GitHub. From there, you can browse the code, open files, and even edit directly on GitHub if needed.

- **Using Local IDE or Codespaces:** You can clone the GitHub repository to your local machine and open it in your favorite IDE (like VS Code, WebStorm, etc.), or use GitHub Codespaces (a cloud IDE on GitHub) for development‚Äã. This means you can write and modify code outside of Lovable‚Äôs interface.









A developer on your team could clone the repo, make extensive changes with full IDE support, run tests locally, and then push commits to GitHub. Because of the integration, those commits will sync back to Lovable automatically‚Äã, so the Lovable project will update to include the changes.

- **Normal GitHub Workflows:** You can leverage all of GitHub‚Äôs collaboration features on your project‚Äôs repo: create **branches** for new features, open **pull requests** to review code before merging, file **issues** and use project boards to track tasks, etc.‚Äã. Lovable doesn‚Äôt interfere with these; it simply watches the default branch for actual code changes. For instance, you might do all your work for a new feature on a `feature` branch, push it to GitHub, get it reviewed via a pull request, and then merge it to `main`. Once merged, Lovable will pull in those changes so the running app updates. This way, teams can enforce code reviews and use GitHub‚Äôs project management, while still benefiting from Lovable‚Äôs rapid development capabilities.

- **Combining AI and Manual Coding:** You can continue to use Lovable‚Äôs AI assistant to generate code or new components, and then inspect or fine-tune that code via GitHub. The integration allows a hybrid workflow: for example, a non-technical founder might use Lovable to scaffold a feature with AI, and a developer can then clean up or optimize that code in the GitHub repo. Both sets of changes merge seamlessly.









For example, use **GitHub Actions** to run tests automatically on each pull request, or to deploy the app to a hosting service whenever `main` gets updated‚Äã

- **Remember:** even while doing heavy development through GitHub, you can always go back to the Lovable editor to use the visual tools or AI chat for assistance. The codebase is the same, so any changes you made by hand will be present in Lovable. This integration makes Lovable a part of your toolchain rather than an isolated environment.


## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/git-integration\#documenting-changes-and-rolling-back)  Documenting Changes and Rolling Back

Working with GitHub encourages good software development practices like documenting changes and managing versions. Here are some tips on managing your code changes and reverting when necessary:

- **Use Meaningful Commit Messages:** Whenever you commit changes (especially when committing via a local IDE or GitHub‚Äôs interface), write a clear commit message describing _what_ you changed and _why_. For example, `"Fix signup form validation bug"` is much more useful than `"update code"`. Good commit messages help team members (and your future self) understand the history of the project. They serve as documentation for the evolution of your app. If Lovable‚Äôs AI made a lot of changes in one go, consider breaking them into logical commits with messages for each major change, if you‚Äôre doing it manually. If commits are being generated automatically, you can always squash or edit them later on GitHub for clarity.
- **Track Versions in Lovable:** Lovable provides a version history in the editor (similar to Google Docs revision history) that keeps track of changes made through the platform. You can access the version history panel to see previous states of your project and even restore an earlier version with one click‚Äã. This is effectively a ‚Äúrollback‚Äù feature built on top of Git ‚Äì if something goes wrong after an AI-generated change or an edit, you can revert to a known good state. It‚Äôs a quick way for non-developers to undo mistakes without using GitHub directly.
- **Rolling Back with Git or Lovable (Reverts):** Since your project is under Git, you can perform rollbacks by reverting commits on GitHub as well. For example, if a certain commit introduced an issue, you (or a developer) can click ‚ÄúRevert‚Äù on GitHub for that commit, or use `git revert` locally and push. This will create a new commit that undoes the changes of the bad commit. Lovable will sync this revert commit and your project will go back to the previous behavior. Always test your app after a revert to ensure the issue is resolved and no other functionality is affected.
- **Use Branches for Big Changes:** A good strategy to reduce the need for rollbacks is to use feature branches for major changes. You might develop a big feature on a separate branch and only merge it to the main branch (which Lovable uses) after it‚Äôs fully tested. This way, your main branch (and the live app in Lovable) stays stable, and you only introduce changes when they are ready. If something on the feature branch isn‚Äôt working, it doesn‚Äôt affect your production code in Lovable until merged.
- **Documentation of Changes:** If you are collaborating with others or handing off the project, consider maintaining a brief **changelog** or using GitHub‚Äôs release notes. While commit messages are the primary log, summarizing changes in human-readable form (e.g., ‚ÄúImplemented user authentication, updated UI for profile page, fixed payment bug‚Äù) can be helpful for non-technical stakeholders to follow progress. You can do this in a Markdown file in the repo or in GitHub Releases.
- **Lovable‚Äôs Rollback Feature:** Lovable automatically backs up your project, so if you made a mistake, you can use the built-in rollback in the Lovable interface to undo accidental changes‚Äã. This is essentially using Git version control under the hood. It ensures that even non-technical users have a safety net ‚Äì you don‚Äôt have to be a Git expert to restore a previous version of your app. However, for complex version management (like maintaining multiple versions or doing partial rollbacks), you will likely use GitHub‚Äôs tools.

By diligently documenting your changes and taking advantage of GitHub‚Äôs and Lovable‚Äôs versioning features, you can move fast with confidence. If a published update causes issues, you have clear records of what changed and multiple ways to revert or fix forward. This significantly de-risks the development process.

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/git-integration\#troubleshooting-%26-faq-github-sync)  Troubleshooting & FAQ (GitHub Sync)

Below are some common questions and issues that users encounter with the GitHub integration, along with guidance on how to resolve them. Click on a question to view the answer.

Why aren‚Äôt my commits showing up in Lovable?

**Possible causes:** The most common reason is that the commits were made on a branch that Lovable isn‚Äôt tracking. Remember, Lovable only syncs with the repository‚Äôs **default branch** (usually `main` or `master`)‚Äã. If you committed to a different branch and haven‚Äôt merged those changes into the default branch, Lovable will not see them. To fix this, merge the branch into the default branch (or change the default branch ‚Äì see the next question). Once the commit is on the default branch, Lovable should pull it in automatically.

Another possibility is an issue with the integration link. For instance, if you **renamed the GitHub repository or changed your GitHub username** after connecting, the webhook/connection might be broken. In such cases, reconnecting your GitHub account to Lovable can re-establish the link. Make sure the Lovable GitHub App still has access to the repo (check your GitHub settings ‚Üí Applications). If it was removed or lost access, re-authorize it and then try pushing the commit again.

Also, double-check that the commit was successfully pushed to GitHub (not just committed locally). If you haven‚Äôt run `git push` (in case of local development), the commit won‚Äôt be on GitHub for Lovable to detect.

If your commits **are on the default branch** and you still don‚Äôt see updates in Lovable, try manually refreshing the project in the Lovable editor. In rare cases, there might be a slight delay or a hiccup in the webhook. Usually, though, commits appear almost instantly when everything is set up correctly.

How do I switch the default branch that Lovable syncs with

Lovable will follow whatever branch is set as the **default** in your GitHub repository settings. By default this is `main` (for new GitHub repos) unless you changed it. If you want Lovable to track a different branch (say you want to use a `development` branch as the main source), you need to change the default branch on GitHub:

1. **On GitHub:** Go to your repository‚Äôs **Settings** \> **Branches** \> **Default branch**. Choose the branch you want to set as the new default, and confirm the change. (If the branch doesn‚Äôt exist yet, you‚Äôll need to create it and perhaps populate it with the current code.)
2. **After Changing:** Once you set a new default, Lovable should start treating that branch as the one to sync. Since Lovable only tracks the default branch‚Äã, changing it effectively points Lovable to the new branch. Give it a moment to fetch the code from the new default branch. All future commits to that branch will sync to Lovable, and edits in Lovable will be pushed to that branch.
3. **Verify in Lovable:** Check the Lovable editor to ensure it‚Äôs now showing the code from the new default branch. You might see an update notification or you might simply notice that any differences (if the branch had different code) are now reflected. If it doesn‚Äôt seem to update, try disconnecting and reconnecting the GitHub integration in Lovable (as a last resort). But typically, this isn‚Äôt required ‚Äî it should follow the default automatically.
4. **Merge Old Changes:** A crucial step is to make sure any important commits from the old default branch get merged into the new default. Changing the default branch on GitHub **does not** automatically merge the content. If you switched default branches because you want to shift development to a new line of work, ensure that the new branch has all the latest code. You may need to merge the previous main into the new branch so nothing is lost. After merging, Lovable will show the combined changes.

Keep in mind that all collaborators will now be pushing to the new default branch by default. Update your team or documentation to avoid confusion. Lovable will now ignore the formerly default branch (it will only pay attention to the new one). If needed, you can always switch back by re-designating the old branch as default in GitHub settings.

How does Lovable detect new commits from GitHub?

Lovable‚Äôs integration uses GitHub‚Äôs API and webhooks under the hood to stay updated. When you first connect to GitHub, you essentially install the Lovable GitHub App on your repo which sets up the communication. So, **when you push a new commit to the default branch**, GitHub notifies the Lovable service (via a webhook event). Lovable then automatically pulls the latest changes into your project‚Äã. This all happens in the background within seconds. That‚Äôs why, as soon as you push code to GitHub, you‚Äôll usually see your Lovable project update almost immediately with no action needed on your part‚Äã.

On the flip side, when you make changes in the Lovable editor, Lovable uses the GitHub connection to push those commits to your repository. This might happen through the Lovable backend using GitHub‚Äôs API ‚Äì for you it‚Äôs seamless: you‚Äôll just notice that new commits (with appropriate messages) show up in your GitHub repo whenever you change something in Lovable.

In summary, Lovable is constantly ‚Äúlistening‚Äù for GitHub commits and ‚Äútalking‚Äù to GitHub when changes occur in the editor. It‚Äôs a two-way sync facilitated by the integration you set up during the connection. You don‚Äôt have to manage any of this process; just know that behind the scenes, webhooks/API calls are keeping everything aligned. If the sync ever seems to stop, it could be due to a broken connection (in which case reconnecting the integration or re-authorizing the GitHub App can re-enable the webhook).

Can I host my Lovable app myself after connecting to GitHub?

Yes. Integrating with GitHub gives you full access to your code, which means you can deploy or host the application outside of Lovable if you want. By default, Lovable provides hosting for your project (when you click ‚ÄúPublish‚Äù in Lovable, it deploys your app to Lovable‚Äôs cloud). This doesn‚Äôt change just because you linked GitHub ‚Äì you can continue to use Lovable‚Äôs hosting **and** have the code on GitHub at the same time.

However, if you prefer to host the app on your own server or another platform, you can do so by using the code from the GitHub repo‚Äã. For example, you could take the repository and deploy it to Vercel, Heroku, AWS, or any environment of your choice. Since the code is a standard web app codebase (Lovable projects are typically full-stack JavaScript/TypeScript apps), you can set it up like any project.

**Even if you host elsewhere, you can still use Lovable to develop**. You might treat Lovable as a powerful visual editor/AI assistant, and when you‚Äôre ready to update your self-hosted app, you push commits to GitHub (via Lovable). Your external deployment pipeline (if set up) would then deploy those new commits. In this scenario, Lovable is for building and GitHub is the single source of truth for both Lovable and your own hosting.

Do note that if you do host the app yourself outside of Lovable, you‚Äôll need to manage environment variables, secrets, database connections, and other config in your new environment just as you would for any app. The Lovable integration with services like Supabase or Stripe will still be in your code ‚Äì those continue to work as long as the appropriate config is in place on the new host.

By following this guide and utilizing GitHub with Lovable, you‚Äôll combine the speed of AI-assisted development with the reliability and control of traditional software practices. This integration is designed to be approachable for non-technical users (you get a safe backup and easy way to hand off code) while providing all the power that developers expect in a modern toolchain.

Happy coding!

Integration with Make

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/make\#what-is-make)  What is Make

![Make website](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lovable-f9060f1e/images/make-hero.png)

[Make](https://www.make.com/) is a powerful no-code automation platform that lets you visually build workflows across apps, APIs, and data sources.

Instead of writing backend logic, you drag, drop, and connect modules in a flowchart-style canvas. It‚Äôs ideal for:

- **Non-developers** who want automation without writing code
- **Developers** who want fast prototyping or extendability via APIs
- **Teams** looking to connect tools like Slack, Airtable, Notion, Calendly, Supabase, and more

With Make, you can:

- **Trigger actions** from your Lovable app (e.g., when a button is clicked)
- **Send and receive data** via webhooks and APIs
- **Connect with 1,500+ tools** or custom APIs
- **Automate** tasks like emailing, AI calling, enrichment, and reminders

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/make\#why-use-make-with-lovable%3F)  Why Use Make with Lovable?

In this below tutorial, Make acts as your **AI-enabled backend**, while Lovable powers the frontend. The result: a custom CRM, built in minutes, fully automated.

This setup is ideal for:

- Non-developers needing advanced logic
- Sales teams with evolving workflows
- Fast iteration without backend overhead
- API-powered automations with real-time UI responses

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/make\#what-we%E2%80%99ll-build)  What we‚Äôll Build

You‚Äôre going to create a CRM with three core data models:

- **Deals** (with stage-based tracking)
- **Contacts** (with inline editing)
- **Companies** (with enrichable data)

Each entity interacts with automations via Make. By the end, you‚Äôll be able to:

- Move a deal and trigger an email
- Click a contact and start an AI sales call
- Click a company and fetch real-time data
- Secure everything via Supabase Edge Functions

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/make\#how-are-we-going-to-build-it)  How are we going to build it

Building your own CRM can take months. With **Lovable** and **Make**, you can ship one in under an hour ‚Äî and automate the entire sales workflow without writing backend code. In this step-by-step guide, you‚Äôll learn how to build a **fully functional, AI-powered CRM**, complete with:

- Visual deal pipelines (drag-and-drop)
- Editable contact and company modals
- AI call agents using [Vapi](https://vapi.ai/)
- Company data enrichment via [Apollo.io](http://apollo.io/)
- Email workflows and security with Supabase
- Real-time automations using [Make](https://www.make.com/)

1

Setting Up Your CRM in Lovable

You need to build a crm system and you need to have: deals, contacts and companies. Make it a light theme.

1

Step 1

Create a new Lovable project. Choose project type: **CRM**.

2

Step 2

Define 3 entities: **Deals**, **Contacts**, and **Companies**.

3

Step 3

Choose **Light Theme** if preferred, and click **Generate**.

![CRM with make](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lovable-f9060f1e/images/crm-make.png)

2

Add Deal Stages (Kanban View)

![Crm Kanban Make ](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lovable-f9060f1e/images/crm-kanban-make.png)

1

Step 1

Open the **Deals** section in Lovable.

2

Step 2

Click **Edit** and introduce five stages:

- **Lead**
- **Qualification**
- **Proposal Sent**
- **Negotiation**
- **Closed - Won/Lost**

3

Step 3

Enable **Drag-and-Drop** functionality for deals to move across stages.

Drag-and-drop lets you automate actions based on deal stage.

**Why?** This allows users to track deals in a visual workflow.

3

Implementing a Contact Management System

![Contact Form Crm Make](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lovable-f9060f1e/images/contact-form-crm-make.png)

1

Step 1

In **Contacts**, enable a **clickable modal view**.

2

Step 2

Make all fields **editable inline** inside the modal.

- The modal displays **contact details**.
- Fields are **editable** for easy updates.

This avoids the need to switch views‚Äîfaster than traditional CRMs.

**Why?** Traditional CRMs redirect users to a new page, slowing down workflow. A modal keeps everything in place.

4

Connect AI-Powered Calls with Make + Vapi

1

Create a Webhook in Make

![Webhook Lovable Make](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lovable-f9060f1e/images/webhook-lovable-make.png)

- Open [Make](https://www.make.com/) and create a **new scenario**.
- Click **Webhooks > Custom Webhook** & name it **Call Contact**.
- Copy the webhook URL.

2

Trigger Call from Lovable

![Ai Assistant Make](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lovable-f9060f1e/images/ai-assistant-make.png)

- In the **Contacts** modal, add a **Call Contact** button.
- Modify the button‚Äôs action to **send JSON data** (name, phone number, company, and call goal) to the Make webhook.
- Test the connection by clicking **Call Contact**.

3

Use Vapi for AI-Powered Calling

![Vapi Make](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lovable-f9060f1e/images/vapi-make.png)

![Vapi Make Automation Pn](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lovable-f9060f1e/images/vapi-make-automation.png)

- In Make, add an **API Call module**.
- Send a request to [Vapi](https://vapi.ai/) with the call details.
- Your custom Vapi agent will:
  - Place the call
  - Follow a dynamic prompt based on the deal
  - Log results back into Lovable

This creates an automated outbound AI call, instantly triggered from your CRM UI.

![Call Customer Make Pn](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lovable-f9060f1e/images/call-customer-make.png)

5

Add Company Data Enrichment with Apollo

1

Create an Enrich Webhook in Make

- Add a second **Custom Webhook** in Make named `Enrich Company`.
- Copy the webhook URL.

![Make Enrich Pn](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lovable-f9060f1e/images/make-enrich.png)

2

Send Request from Lovable

- In **Companies**, add an **Enrich Company** button.
- When clicked, send the company‚Äôs domain as a JSON payload.

When I click the enrich button, do following things:

1. Remove the modal that opens NOT needed anymore
2. Real new step > send the domain as JSON to following webhook: \[Link\]
3. You will receive a webhook response as JSOn and you need to dynamically parse this into the modal view so create dynamic fields.

3

Call Apollo.io API

![Apollo Make Lovable Pn](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lovable-f9060f1e/images/apollo-make-lovable.png)

- Use Apollo‚Äôs [Organization Enrichment API.](https://apollo.io/docs)
- Fetch:
  - Industry
  - Employee count
  - Address
  - Website
  - Funding
- Return the enriched data to Lovable.

4

Parse Response into Modal View

![Webhook Apollo Webhook Make Pn](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lovable-f9060f1e/images/webhook-apollo-webhook-make.png)

- Dynamically generate fields in the Lovable modal from the JSON.
- Present data in a readable UI (not raw JSON).

Apollo enrichment adds key insights to help qualify companies faster.

6

Hide API Calls with Supabase Edge Functions

![Make Supabase Automation Pn](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lovable-f9060f1e/images/make-supabase-automation.png)

To secure webhooks:

- Enable **Supabase Integration** in project settings.
- Create an **Edge Function** that proxies requests to Make.
- Update Lovable to call your Supabase function instead of the direct Webhook.

This hides your Webhook URL from the browser ‚Äî essential for public apps.

Please when clicking the enrich button, use a Supabase edge function to hide the API call to the webhook address. YOU need to change therefore the functionality and actual hiding the API call.

7

Automating Follow-Ups and Workflows

To automate Email campaigns based on Deal stages:

- In Make, add logic to trigger events:
  - Send an email when a deal moves to **Proposal Sent**
  - Notify team via Slack when a deal reaches **Negotiation**
  - Add contacts to a newsletter or campaign flow

This keeps your sales motion running even when you‚Äôre not online.

8

Final Test & Deploy

1

Run End-to-End Tests

- Create test deals and contacts.
- Trigger the AI call flow.
- Enrich company data and verify results.

2

Deploy, Share & Go Live

- Use **Custom Domain** to personalize your CRM.
- Share your app with your team.

9

You‚Äôve built a full-featured, AI-powered CRM ‚Äî no backend required.

**Next Steps**

- Add integrations: Slack, Notion, HubSpot, Calendly
- Secure everything with Supabase, add audit trails

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/make\#pro-tips-from-the-live-session)  Pro Tips from the Live Session

- Combine Vapi + Apollo + Make for real-time AI workflows
- Use Supabase Edge Functions to mask all public API/webhook calls

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/make\#faq)  FAQ

What is Make?

Make is a visual automation platform that lets you connect tools and build workflows using drag-and-drop modules. Think of it as Zapier but more flexible and developer-friendly.

Why use Make with Lovable?

- No need to write backend code
- Trigger workflows from your UI (buttons, forms, modals)
- Build automations visually (call agents, enrichment, email flows)
- Connect to 1,500+ apps (Slack, Notion, Calendly, Airtable, and more)

How does Make communicate with Lovable?

Lovable sends data (usually as JSON) via **HTTP webhooks** to Make scenarios. Make receives that data, processes it (e.g., calls an API), and can respond back to Lovable.

What are Scenarios in Make?

Scenarios are automation workflows. You define:

- Triggers (e.g., Webhook)
- Actions (e.g., API call, email send)
- Logic (routers, filters, iterations)

Can I secure my Make Webhooks?

Yes. Use:

- **IP restrictions** (limit who can call the webhook)
- **Supabase Edge Functions** to proxy and hide sensitive URLs
- **API Key authentication** in headers

What‚Äôs the difference between Make and Supabase Edge Functions?

- **Make** is a visual automation tool (great for workflows, API integrations, AI triggers).
- **Supabase Edge Functions** are serverless backend code (great for logic, auth, and security).

Use them **together** for best results.

What happens if I exceed my Make plan's operations?

Your scenario will pause. Make sends alerts, and you can upgrade or optimize your flows. For this guide, the **free pro plan** from the webinar includes **20,000 operations** ‚Äî more than enough to prototype.

Can I test my Make Scenarios without Lovable?

Yes! Use **manual data input** in the Webhook or trigger the scenario via Postman or curl. This is great for debugging before connecting to Lovable.

Step 1 ‚Äì Build a Language Tutor App

We start by creating a Spanish-learning web app with Lovable. This includes:

- A user login flow
- AI-powered chat for Spanish tutoring
- Voice recording and playback
- Translation features

This gives users a personalized AI tutor that they can talk to, type to, and learn with.

![Course Dashboard Pn](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lovable-f9060f1e/images/course-dashboard.png)

2

Step 2 ‚Äì Generate Courses with AI

We enhance the app with AI-generated courses:

![Course Creation Ai Pn](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lovable-f9060f1e/images/course-creation-ai.png)

- Users define a topic (e.g., _Questions to ask at a barbecue_).
- An OpenAI-powered function creates 10 multiple choice questions in Spanish.
- Courses are saved to the user‚Äôs account with Supabase and can be revisited anytime.
![Course Creation Ai 2 Pn](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lovable-f9060f1e/images/course-creation-ai-2.png)
- Users get feedback on each question with explanations.
- Automatically generate a **course banner image** that matches the topic. Replicate uses the **Flux Schnell** model for fast image generation and dynamically inject the image into the course page.

**How it Works:**

1. We call the Replicate API when a new course is created.
2. The prompt is dynamically generated based on the course topic.
3. Replicate returns an image URL, which is used as the banner for the course.

![Replicate Real Time Pn](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lovable-f9060f1e/images/replicate-real-time.png)

3

Step 3 ‚Äì Add Visuals with Replicate

Now, let‚Äôs make things visual with Replicate.

![Replicate Image Pn](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lovable-f9060f1e/images/replicate-image.png)

**Example Prompt:**

A beautiful, educational, and engaging scene about topic in digital art style. Vibrant colors. No text on image.

**Example Response Handling:**

Some Replicate models return a single image URL, others return an array. Make sure your Lovable function correctly extracts the output, e.g.:

Copy

```
const imageUrl = response.output[0]
```

4

Step 4 ‚Äì Use Replicate Playground for Fine-Tuning

Replicate‚Äôs Playground makes it easy to test prompts and get code snippets:

- Tweak prompts until you‚Äôre happy with the output
- Use the API snippet generator for Node.js, Python, etc.
- Copy-paste directly into Lovable‚Äôs backend functions

Use Playground Beta to compare multiple outputs at once.

![Replicate Playground Pn](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lovable-f9060f1e/images/replicate-playground.png)

5

Step 5 ‚Äì Real-Time Conversations with OpenAI

To simulate human conversations, we added a real-time Spanish-speaking feature using OpenAI‚Äôs WebRTC API:

- Users can speak directly to their AI tutor.
- The AI understands, responds, and corrects pronunciation in real time.
- This makes language learning much more immersive and practical.

This feature integrates smoothly with Lovable‚Äôs voice input, WebRTC handling, and frontend chat UI.

![Course Voice Ai Pn](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lovable-f9060f1e/images/course-voice-ai.png)

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/replicate\#tips-%26-gotchas)  Tips & Gotchas

- **Model Output Variance**: Replicate models differ in how they return outputs. Always inspect the actual JSON returned from the playground.
- **Prompt Iteration is Key**: Small prompt changes can greatly affect image quality. Use the playground to experiment.
- **Backend Logs**: Use Supabase Edge logs to debug your API calls. Lovable supports in-app log fetching.
- **Version Control in Lovable**: Each prompt edit is auto-committed, but you can manually track checkpoints using the ‚ÄúDeploy‚Äù feature for production-ready states.

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/replicate\#faq)  FAQ

What is Replicate, in simple terms?

Replicate is a platform that lets you run powerful machine learning models (like image or video generation) using a simple API‚Äîno need to train or host models yourself.

Who typically uses Replicate?

Replicate is popular with indie hackers, startup builders, and large enterprises alike. Whether you‚Äôre prototyping an AI feature or deploying at scale, Replicate supports both quick hacks and robust deployments.

Do I need my own Replicate API key?

Yes. Lovable securely stores your keys and handles API calls for you once added.

What models can I use on Replicate?

Replicate supports many modalities including:

- Image generation (e.g. Flux Schnell)
- Video generation
- Audio and text-to-speech
- Language models (though not Replicate‚Äôs main focus)
- Custom Cog models (open-source Dockerized models you can deploy)

Explore them all at [replicate.com/explore](https://replicate.com/explore).

How do I know which model is right for my use case?

Use Replicate‚Äôs **Playground** to test different models before integrating them. The Playground lets you tweak prompts, compare outputs, and copy working code snippets for your app.

What‚Äôs the difference between Replicate's old and new API endpoints?

Replicate has two API formats:

- The original ( `/predictions`) endpoint: most widely known and used.
- The newer `/models/{owner}/{model}/versions/{id}/predictions` endpoint: more efficient and flexible.

Lovable integrates with both depending on the model‚Äôs requirements.

What if a model returns a different JSON structure than expected?

Model outputs vary. Some return a string URL, others return an array. Use the Replicate Playground to inspect the real response and update your parsing logic accordingly.

Example fix:

Copy

```
const imageUrl = Array.isArray(output) ? output[0] : output;
```

Can I trigger Replicate image generation only once, or on every course view?

You can choose:

- **One-time generation on course creation**: Saves compute costs and creates a consistent visual identity.
- **Dynamic generation per session**: If you want fresh visuals each time.

In the tutorial, we chose to generate the image once when the course is first created.

Does Lovable know how to work with Replicate out of the box?

Yes! Lovable has built-in knowledge about Replicate and many of its popular models. It can auto-generate integration code for you using the right packages and prompt structure.

How does Lovable handle package installation like replicate for Node.js?

Lovable automatically installs and configures packages when needed, based on your prompt and integration context. You don‚Äôt have to npm install manually unless debugging locally.

What‚Äôs the workflow for debugging Replicate errors in Lovable?

- Use Lovable‚Äôs **Superbase Edge function logs** to trace issues.
- If there‚Äôs a mismatch between expected vs. actual Replicate response, update your JSON handling.
- Use the **‚ÄúFix this‚Äù** button in Lovable to retry or refactor the function logic.

Can I checkpoint my working app state in Lovable?

Currently, every prompt change creates a commit. You can:

- Use the **History** tab to navigate commits (including bookmarking commits)
- **Deploy** a version to make it a production checkpoint
- GitHub sync is available for custom version control

How does GitHub integration work with Lovable?

You can export your Lovable project to GitHub with **two-way sync**:

- Lovable pushes changes to GitHub
- You (or your team) can make changes in an IDE and push back
- Works great for frontend in Lovable + backend in your own editor

What are LLM-friendly .lm.txt or .lm.md files?

These are simplified markdown-based docs optimized for language models. Replicate is actively working on adding these to help Lovable (and other tools) better understand its models automatically.

Do I need to handle prompt tuning myself?

Yes, prompt crafting is essential. Lovable helps with auto-prompting and templating, but you should always test in the Replicate Playground to refine the inputs for best results.

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/resend\#resend-integration-faq)  Resend Integration FAQ

What is Resend?

Resend is an email API built for developers. It focuses on high deliverability, ease of integration, and a clean developer experience for sending transactional and marketing emails.

Do I need a paid Resend plan to follow this tutorial?

No. You can complete the entire CRM setup using **Resend‚Äôs free tier**, which supports sending emails from a verified domain and up to 3,000 contacts for marketing emails.

How do I verify a domain in Resend?

Go to Resend ‚Üí **Domains** ‚Üí Add your domain. You‚Äôll be given DNS records (TXT, MX) to add via your DNS provider (e.g., Cloudflare, Namecheap). Once added, click **Verify**.

Use a subdomain like `updates.yourdomain.com` to isolate your email reputation.

Why are my Resend emails going to spam?

There are a few common reasons:

- You haven‚Äôt verified your domain
- Your email lacks a plain-text version
- You‚Äôre sending from a generic sender like `onboarding@resend.dev`
- You‚Äôre not following best practices (e.g., missing unsubscribe links in marketing emails)

Use Resend‚Äôs **Deliverability Insights** panel to get actionable tips.

Can I customize the design of the emails I send?

Yes. Use [React Email](https://react.email/)‚Äîan open-source library by the Resend team‚Äîto design styled, responsive emails with React components.

Does Resend support marketing emails or only transactional?

Resend supports **both**:

- **Transactional emails** (confirmation, reset, notifications) using the API or SDK.
- **Marketing emails** via the **Broadcast** feature and **Audiences**.

You can create, preview, and track campaigns from the dashboard.

How do I manage newsletter subscribers in Resend?

Use **Audiences**:

- Add contacts manually, via CSV, or programmatically using the API.
- Each Audience has a unique ID you can use to associate subscriptions.
- Users can unsubscribe automatically via Resend‚Äôs built-in unsubscribe link.

Can I set up double opt-in for newsletters?

Not by default, but you can implement it manually:

1. On form submission, send an initial confirmation email.
2. Ask users to click a link.
3. On click, confirm their subscription and add them to your Resend audience.

Can I schedule or automate email flows in Resend?

Not yet. Resend doesn‚Äôt currently support drip campaigns or automated sequences.

Workaround:

Use **Supabase Cron Jobs** to schedule tasks that trigger Resend emails at set intervals.

How do I connect Resend to Supabase Auth?

Use the official Supabase Integration by Resend:

1. Authenticate with your Supabase project.
2. Provide a domain and sender name.
3. Resend automatically configures your Supabase auth emails to use your Resend account.

How does Resend handle unsubscribes?

Resend automatically processes unsubscribes:

- You must include an unsubscribe link in broadcast emails.
- When a user unsubscribes, they are removed from the selected audience.
- This is required for email compliance (e.g., CAN-SPAM, GDPR).

Supabase is an open-source alternative to Firebase, providing a hosted PostgreSQL database with real-time capabilities, user authentication, file storage, and serverless functions. By connecting Supabase to your Lovable app, you instantly gain a production-ready backend without writing any boilerplate code or manually configuring servers. Supabase‚Äôs intuitive web dashboard makes it easy to manage your data and users, and its robust SQL foundation means you retain the full power and scalability of a PostgreSQL database.

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/supabase\#key-features-unlocked-by-supabase-integration%3A)  **Key features unlocked by Supabase integration:**

- **Database (PostgreSQL)** ‚Äì Store and query your app data with full SQL support. Lovable can automatically generate the necessary tables and schema based on your prompts.
- **User Authentication** ‚Äì Securely manage user sign-ups, logins, and access control. Lovable can add pre-built authentication flows (email/password, etc.) to your app with a simple prompt.
- **File Storage** ‚Äì Upload and serve images or other files via Supabase Storage. Great for user profile photos, uploads, or any static media your app needs to handle.
- **Real-time Updates** ‚Äì Supabase can stream live data changes to your app. This enables features like live chat, activity feeds, or collaborative dashboards that update instantly for all users.
- **Edge Functions (Serverless)** ‚Äì Run custom backend logic (in JavaScript/TypeScript) on Supabase‚Äôs infrastructure. Lovable will create and deploy these functions for tasks like sending emails, processing payments, or integrating with external APIs.

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/supabase\#why-use-lovable%E2%80%99s-supabase-integration%3F)  **Why use Lovable‚Äôs Supabase integration?**

With Lovable, you don‚Äôt have to juggle separate tools for front-end design and back-end setup. By simply conversing with Lovable‚Äôs AI, you can build your UI _and_ have the underlying database and server functions created for you automatically. This means faster development and fewer integration headaches. For example, if you prompt Lovable with ‚ÄúAdd a user feedback form and save responses to the database,‚Äù Lovable will generate the form UI **and** set up a Supabase table to store the feedback ‚Äì all in one go. This seamless end-to-end generation is Lovable‚Äôs unique strength, empowering beginners to build complex apps and allowing power users to move faster.

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/supabase\#getting-started%3A-connecting-supabase-to-lovable)  Getting Started: Connecting Supabase to Lovable

Connecting a Supabase backend to your Lovable project is straightforward. You‚Äôll need a Supabase account (free tier is fine) and a Lovable project ready. If you don‚Äôt have a Supabase account yet, you can sign up at the Supabase website ‚Äì no credit card required for the free tier.

Connect Supabase to Lovable

1

Initiate the Supabase connection in Lovable.

In the Lovable editor, open the **Integrations** menu (usually found in the top-right toolbar). Click **Connect Supabase**. Lovable will prompt you to log in to Supabase if you aren‚Äôt already.

2

Authorize and select or create a project.

A Supabase login screen will appear. Sign into your Supabase account and authorize Lovable. Next, you‚Äôll be asked to choose a Supabase **organization** and **project** to link with your Lovable app. You can select an existing project or create a new one on the spot (Lovable‚Äôs chat will guide you through creating a new Supabase project if needed).

3

Wait for configuration to complete.

After selecting the project, Lovable will automatically configure the connection. Within a few seconds, you should see a confirmation message in the chat (e.g. ‚Äú‚úÖ Supabase connected‚Äù). At this point, your Lovable app is now linked to the Supabase database ‚Äì ready to use authentication, data storage, and other backend features.

Both Lovable and Supabase offer generous free tiers for development. If your app grows or requires advanced features, you may eventually need paid plans for each service separately. For now, you can experiment without incurring costs.

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/supabase\#adding-user-authentication)  Adding User Authentication

One of the first things you‚Äôll likely want is user authentication (so people can sign up and log into your app). Lovable‚Äôs Supabase integration makes this trivial to set up via chat.

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/supabase\#email-and-password-basic-setup)  Email and Password (Basic Setup)

Once your project is connected to Supabase, Lovable can generate authentication pages for you. For example, you can simply prompt: **‚ÄúAdd login‚Äù**. This will typically create a basic login page (and related signup flow) in your app, wired up to Supabase‚Äôs authentication system.

After Lovable adds the login UI, you have a couple of ways to create users for testing:

Example prompt:

Copy

```
Add login
```

- **Via your app‚Äôs signup form:** Use the newly added interface in your app to register a user (this will communicate with Supabase to create the account).
- **Via Supabase Dashboard:** Go to your Supabase project‚Äôs dashboard, navigate to **Authentication > Users**, and manually add a new user (email and password). This is handy to set up a test account quickly.

For development convenience, we recommend disabling email confirmation in Supabase while you test. This way, users can log in immediately without needing to verify an email. To do this, open your Supabase dashboard and go to **Authentication > Settings (or Providers) > Email**, then **disable the ‚ÄúConfirm email‚Äù requirement**. You can re-enable confirmations later in production for security.

Lovable will have already configured your Lovable app to recognize authenticated users (for example, gating certain pages to logged-in users only, if appropriate). You can further customize the look and feel of the login/signup pages using Lovable‚Äôs editor or prompts. Supabase Integration 2.0 even allows adding extra fields to your signup form or styling the form to match your brand.

Supabase supports OAuth logins like Google, GitHub, Twitter, and more. You can integrate these into your Lovable app as well:

1. **Enable the provider in Supabase:** In your Supabase dashboard, navigate to **Authentication > Providers**. You‚Äôll see a list of external login providers. Toggle on **Google** (for example) and follow the instructions to provide the required OAuth Client ID and Secret from Google. _(Supabase will guide you on how to obtain these credentials from Google‚Äôs developer console.)_ Save the settings ‚Äì your Supabase project now knows how to handle Google logins.
2. **Update your Lovable app‚Äôs UI:** Next, you can prompt Lovable to add a social login option. For instance: **‚ÄúAdd a ‚ÄòSign in with Google‚Äô button to the login page.‚Äù** Lovable will modify the authentication page, adding a Google sign-in button and the necessary code to initiate the OAuth flow via Supabase.

Once this is done, users of your app will be able to click ‚ÄúSign in with Google‚Äù, be redirected to Google for authentication, and then return to your app as logged-in users. You can enable other providers (GitHub, Facebook, etc.) in a similar way ‚Äì just remember to configure each in Supabase and then adjust your Lovable UI accordingly.

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/supabase\#managing-data-with-supabase)  Managing Data with Supabase

Beyond authentication, the core of most apps is reading and writing data. With Lovable and Supabase, you can create database tables and connect them to your UI without leaving the chat prompt.

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/supabase\#creating-database-tables-via-lovable)  Creating Database Tables via Lovable

After connecting Supabase, whenever you need to store data persistently, you can instruct Lovable and it will coordinate the database setup for you. The process typically looks like this:

1

Describe the feature and data you need

In Lovable‚Äôs chat, request a feature that involves data storage. For example, you might say: **‚ÄúAdd a feedback form and save responses in a database table.‚Äù** Be as clear as possible about what data you want to store (e.g. user feedback with a message and rating, or an inventory item with name, price, etc.). Lovable will use this information to determine what database structure is required.

2

Review the generated SQL snippet

Lovable‚Äôs AI will propose updates to your app. Since your request involves storing data, Lovable will also produce a SQL schema snippet ‚Äì essentially the commands to create the necessary table(s) or columns in Supabase. For example, it might say something like: \_‚ÄúI will create a table _`feedback`with columns \_ `id`, `message`, and `rating`‚Äù_ and provide the SQL code for that. This snippet appears in the chat or sidebar for you to copy.

3

Run the SQL in Supabase

Open your Supabase dashboard and go to the **SQL Editor**. Paste the SQL snippet from Lovable and execute it, which will create the new table (or alter an existing table) in your database. You can verify in the Supabase **Table Editor** that the table now exists with the specified columns.

4

Confirm and let Lovable finish integration

Back in Lovable, confirm that you ran the SQL (the chat might ask for confirmation, or you can simply tell Lovable ‚Äúdone‚Äù or click a provided confirmation). Lovable will then finalize the integration: it updates your app‚Äôs UI to bind form inputs, lists, or other components to the new Supabase table. Continuing our example, the feedback form in your app is now connected‚Äîwhen a user submits feedback, it will be saved into the `feedback` table, and you can retrieve and display those entries as well.

That‚Äôs it\\! You didn‚Äôt have to manually design a database schema or write any backend code ‚Äì Lovable and Supabase handled it from your description. You can repeat this process for any new data feature (blog posts, comments, products, etc.).

For example, if you want users to be able to post articles in your app, you could prompt: **‚ÄúAllow users to create posts with a title and content, and store these in the database.‚Äù** Lovable would generate a `posts` table (with fields for title, content, author, timestamps, etc.), give you the SQL to add it to Supabase, and then wire up the front-end forms and pages to that table.

Supabase‚Äôs dashboard offers a rich interface to manage your data. You can view and edit table rows in a spreadsheet-like UI, define relationships between tables, and even import data from CSV or Excel. Under the hood, it‚Äôs all PostgreSQL ‚Äì which means you can perform complex queries or use SQL features as needed. Supabase even provides an **AI SQL Assistant** in its SQL editor to help you write queries if you‚Äôre not familiar with SQL. This can be handy for advanced analysis or troubleshooting.

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/supabase\#file-storage-images-%26-media)  File Storage (Images & Media)

When your Lovable app needs to handle file uploads (for example, user profile pictures, attachments, or any media), Supabase integration has you covered. Supabase includes a **Storage** service for hosting files (images, videos, PDFs, etc.) conveniently alongside your database.

If you add an **Upload** component or an image upload feature in your Lovable app, Lovable will utilize Supabase Storage behind the scenes. Uploaded files will be stored in a storage bucket within your Supabase project, and you‚Äôll get a URL or reference to use for displaying or downloading the file later.

By default, Supabase‚Äôs free tier allows files up to **50MB** each to be uploaded. This is plenty for most images or short videos. If your app needs to handle larger files, Supabase‚Äôs paid plans support bigger uploads (including **resumable uploads** for very large files). You can organize files into folders (buckets) and manage access permissions via the Supabase dashboard as needed.

Suppose your app has user profiles and you want users to add a profile picture. You might prompt Lovable: _‚ÄúAdd a profile picture upload to the account settings page.‚Äù_ Lovable will create the UI for uploading an image. Thanks to the Supabase integration, when a user uploads a file, it‚Äôs saved in your Supabase Storage (in a bucket, e.g. `public/avatar-images`), and Lovable will handle retrieving that image URL to display the profile picture in your app. All of this happens without you writing any storage-handling code.

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/supabase\#storing-secrets-api-keys-%26-config)  Storing Secrets (API Keys & Config)

Many applications require secret keys or API credentials to connect with third-party services ‚Äî for example, Stripe for payments or OpenAI for AI features. When Supabase is connected, Lovable offers a secure way to manage and use these secrets.

Lovable automatically detects when a feature requires a secret and prompts you with a UI to input the necessary values.

These secrets are stored securely in Supabase‚Äôs Edge Function secret manager for your project. They are encrypted and kept safe on the backend. When you deploy Edge Functions (see next section), they can access these secrets to connect with external services.

For example, if you integrate Stripe for payments, you would store your Stripe Secret Key as a secret. When Lovable deploys a payment-processing function to Supabase, it will automatically include that key from the secret store so the function can authenticate with Stripe. This way, you never have to hard-code secrets into your app, and you avoid exposing them publicly.

Sometimes your app needs custom backend logic beyond basic data CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete). **Supabase Edge Functions** are serverless functions (similar to AWS Lambda) that let you run code on the backend triggered by events or requests. Lovable‚Äôs integration means you can define desired backend behavior in plain language, and Lovable will write and deploy the necessary Edge Function code to Supabase for you.

Typical use cases for Edge Functions in Lovable include:

- **Using AI services:** e.g. processing some input with OpenAI or Anthropic APIs (with the API key stored as a secret as described above).
- **Sending emails or notifications:** e.g. sending a welcome email when a user signs up, via an email API like Resend.
- **Processing payments:** e.g. creating a checkout session or fulfilling an order using Stripe‚Äôs API.
- **Scheduled tasks:** e.g. performing a cleanup or summary job every hour/day (Supabase Edge Functions can be triggered on a schedule).
- **Complex computations or third-party integrations:** any code that you don‚Äôt want to run on the client-side can be done in an Edge Function.

To add a backend function, simply describe what you need in the Lovable chat. For example: _‚ÄúWhen a user submits the feedback form, analyze the text using OpenAI and store a sentiment score.‚Äù_ Lovable will generate the code for this logic as a Supabase Edge Function (in this case, calling the OpenAI API) and deploy it to your Supabase project. It will also update your Lovable app to call this function at the right time (e.g., on form submission) and handle the response.

You can find and monitor your Edge Functions in the Supabase dashboard under **Functions**. Each function will have logs that show recent executions and any output or errors. Lovable‚Äôs Supabase Integration 2.0 improves this experience by automatically reading those logs when something goes wrong ‚Äì if your function errors out, Lovable will surface the error message in the chat to help you troubleshoot. Of course, you can always check the Supabase logs yourself for more details or for peace of mind.

**Before going live:** Supabase‚Äôs default security rules are permissive for development, but you should set up **Row Level Security (RLS)** policies to protect your data in production. RLS allows you to define who can read or write each row in your database tables (for example, ensuring users can only access their own data). Lovable can assist in generating basic RLS policies if you prompt it (for instance, ‚ÄúApply security policies so users can only edit their own feedback‚Äù). However, always review and test these policies in the Supabase dashboard under **Auth > Policies**. Proper security setup is crucial before you invite real users to your app.

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/supabase\#faq)  FAQ

What does the Supabase integration actually do for me?

It gives your Lovable app a fully managed backend. Without it, Lovable can still build your UI, but you‚Äôd have nowhere to persist data or manage users out-of-the-box. With Supabase connected, Lovable can create user accounts (authentication), store and retrieve data in a database, upload files, run server-side code, and more ‚Äì all automatically. Essentially, Supabase provides the databases and servers behind your app, and Lovable drives it through prompts.

Do I need separate accounts for Lovable and Supabase?

Yes. Lovable and Supabase are two separate platforms. You will need an account on Supabase (to host your database) in addition to your Lovable account. The good news is both have free tiers, so you can get started without any cost. Just remember that if you later upgrade for more usage or features, you‚Äôd handle billing for each service individually.

How do I connect Lovable with Supabase?

1. In the Lovable editor, go to the **Integrations** section.
2. Click **Connect to Supabase** and follow the authentication steps.
3. If needed, create a new Supabase project within Lovable.
4. Lovable will automatically generate the necessary database schema and connect it to your project.

Can I integrate my Supabase-connected Lovable app with external automation tools?

Absolutely. When you use Lovable + Supabase, your data lives in Supabase‚Äôs database and Supabase also provides auto-generated RESTful APIs for your tables (as well as a client library). This means you can use tools like Zapier, [Make.com](http://make.com/), or any other service to interact with your app‚Äôs backend data via HTTP requests. For example, Zapier could fetch or add records to a Supabase table of your app. Additionally, you can create custom API endpoints using Supabase Edge Functions (which Lovable can help create) to trigger more complex workflows. In short, integrating with third-party automation services is doable ‚Äì it just might involve a bit of configuration with Supabase‚Äôs API keys or webhooks.

How scalable is Supabase for when my app grows?

Supabase is built on **PostgreSQL**, which can handle large amounts of data and high traffic. Out of the box, your free database can handle a decent workload (millions of rows, multiple connections). As your needs grow, you can upgrade your Supabase plan for more storage, throughput, and features. Many production apps run entirely on Supabase, so you‚Äôre in good hands. Just be mindful of the usage limits on the free tier (which Supabase documents on their site) and plan to scale up if you approach those limits.

How can I add real-time features like a chat or live feed to my app?

Supabase has built-in real-time subscriptions on your database. This means your app can listen for changes (inserts, updates, deletes) on specific tables and react instantly. To leverage this, you would design your Lovable app feature as usual (e.g. a chat room that writes messages to a `messages` table). Lovable knows about Supabase‚Äôs real-time capabilities, so it can set up the front-end to subscribe to that table‚Äôs changes. In practice, after you‚Äôve created a table for, say, chat messages, you can prompt Lovable to **‚Äúenable real-time updates for the chat‚Äù** and it will use Supabase‚Äôs real-time API under the hood. Users will then see new messages appear live without needing to refresh. This works for any scenario where live updates are useful (comments, notifications, dashboards, etc.).

Is there a limit to file uploads with Supabase storage?

On the free tier, Supabase limits individual file upload size to **50MB**. This covers most use cases like images, audio, or short videos. If you need to handle larger files (such as lengthy videos or large datasets), upgrading to a paid plan enables larger and even resumable uploads. Also note there‚Äôs an overall storage quota per project (e.g. how many total GB you can store) that increases with higher plans.

How do I configure authentication in Supabase?

Lovable automatically sets up authentication, but you may need to:

- Go to **Supabase Dashboard > Authentication**.
- Enable **Email Sign-in/Sign-up**.
- Disable email confirmation for easier local testing.

Can I use one Supabase database for multiple Lovable projects?

Yes, you can. You might build multiple front-end applications in Lovable that all connect to the same Supabase project (and thus share the same database and auth). This is advanced, but it‚Äôs possible ‚Äì for example, a main app and an admin dashboard as separate Lovable projects using one common database. When connecting Supabase in each project, just select the same Supabase project. Keep in mind all those apps will read/write the same data, so design accordingly.

What if I want to test changes to my database without affecting the live app?

At the moment, each Lovable project connects to one Supabase project, and Lovable doesn‚Äôt have a built-in staging mode. If you want a safe playground to experiment, Supabase offers a feature called **Branching** which lets you create a temporary copy of your database (like a git branch) to test changes. You could connect a separate Lovable project to a branch or duplicate of your database for testing. In general, for serious projects you‚Äôd use caution making schema changes on a live app ‚Äì perhaps create a backup or use branching, then merge changes when ready. Lovable‚Äôs integration is evolving, so future updates might introduce more seamless staging workflows.

Does Supabase or Lovable help me write custom SQL or database logic?

Yes. Supabase‚Äôs web interface includes an **AI SQL Assistant** that can generate SQL queries from natural language. So if you need a complex query or are not comfortable writing SQL, you can try that tool in the Supabase SQL editor. On Lovable‚Äôs side, you typically don‚Äôt need to hand-write SQL at all ‚Äì the AI handles most of the schema creation and queries for you. But if you‚Äôre an advanced user and want to do something custom, you can always use Lovable‚Äôs GitHub integration to inspect or edit the code, or run raw SQL on the database as needed.

How do I handle payments in my Lovable app?

Payments are handled via integrations like Stripe, which you can use in conjunction with Supabase Edge Functions. For instance, you might prompt Lovable: ‚ÄúAdd a checkout button and process payments with Stripe.‚Äù Lovable would then create an Edge Function that talks to Stripe‚Äôs API (using your Stripe secret key stored as a secret) and perhaps store the transaction details in your Supabase database. The UI would be updated to include the checkout/pay button. Essentially, Supabase provides the environment (Edge Functions, database) to implement payments, and Lovable can scaffold the code for you. For more details, you can also refer to the Stripe & Payments integration guide in Lovable‚Äôs documentation, which covers setting up Stripe specifically.

Features

Custom domain

When you create a project, Lovable makes it easy to [publish it](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/deploy) with the click of a button.

By default, your Lovable app is accessible via a Lovable staging subdomain (e.g., `yoursite.lovable.app`). However, you can connect your site to a custom domain (e.g., `yourdomain.com`) or a subdomain (e.g., `subdomain.yourdomain.com`) that you own.

Using a custom domain enhances your brand, improves [SEO](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/seo) discoverability, and makes your site easier to find and remember.

If you want to have a custom domain, see below.

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/custom-domain\#using-entri)  Using Entri

To connect a custom domain, navigate to **Project > Settings > Domains** in Lovable.

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/custom-domain\#requirements)  Requirements

- A **paid Lovable plan** is required to connect a custom domain.
- You **must own** a domain before proceeding. If you don‚Äôt have one, you can purchase it from a domain provider such as:

  - [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/)
  - [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/)
  - [View full list of domain providers](https://developers.entri.com/provider-list)

Lovable uses [**Entri**](https://www.entri.com/) to facilitate quick and seamless domain connections.

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/custom-domain\#step-by-step-guide)  Step-by-Step Guide

1

Step 1

Navigate to **Project > Settings > Domains** and click **Connect Domain**.

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lovable-f9060f1e/images/project-setting.png)

2

Step 2

Click **Continue**.

3

Step 3

Enter the domain you want to connect (e.g., `yourdomain.com`).

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lovable-f9060f1e/images/connect-entri.png)

4

Step 4

Click **Continue**.

5

Step 5

Search for and select your **DNS provider** (the service where you purchased your domain).

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lovable-f9060f1e/images/dns-provider.png)

Domain providers are amongst many: _123-Reg, Amazon Route 53, arsys, Aruba IT, Bluehost, Cloudflare, Crazy Domains, DigitalOcean, DNSimple, Domain.com, DreamHost, Dynadot, EasyDNS, Enom, Gandi, Hetzner, Home PI, HostGator, Hostinger, Hover, Inmotion Hosting, IONIS, iwantmyname, Localweb, Name.com, NameBright, Namecheap, NameSilo, Netlify, Network Solutions, One.com, OpenSrs, OVH Global, Porkbun, Register.com, Register.it, Registro, Shopify, SiteGround, Spaceship, Strato, TransIP, United Domains DE, Web.com, WordPress and Xneelo._

6

Step 6

Follow the on-screen instructions to **sign in to your DNS provider** and authorize the connection to [Entri](https://www.entri.com/).

7

Step 7

Click **Close Window** to complete the connection and return to **Site Settings**.

8

Step 8

Click **Done**.

DNS changes may take up to **48 hours** to propagate globally, though most updates occur within a few hours.

9

You're All Set! üéâ

Your Lovable app is now available on your custom domain.

My custom domain is connected, but my site isn‚Äôt live. What should I do?

DNS propagation can take up to **48 hours** due to factors such as TTL (Time to Live) and internet service provider delays. If your site isn‚Äôt live yet:

- Wait a bit longer for DNS changes to fully update.
- Use a tool like [whatsmydns](https://www.whatsmydns.net/) to check the status of your DNS records.
- Clear your browser cache to ensure you‚Äôre viewing the latest version of your site.

My site isn‚Äôt appearing after 48 hours. What now?

- Double-check that your **DNS records** are correctly set in your domain provider‚Äôs settings.
- If issues persist, contact your **domain provider‚Äôs support team**.
- If your DNS settings are correct but the site still doesn‚Äôt load, reach out to **Lovable‚Äôs customer support** for assistance.

Can I buy a domain through Lovable?

For this launch, Lovable will **not** support buying domains. We may launch domain purchasing later if these issues are resolved.

How does connecting a custom domain impact my site's SEO?

Using a custom domain improves your site‚Äôs SEO by enhancing brand credibility, allowing for better indexing by search engines, and enabling features like custom meta tags and structured data. For more SEO tips, visit [Lovable SEO Guide](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/seo).

How to remove a custom domain?

1. Access the **Project > Settings > Domains.**
2. Click ‚ÄúRemove domain‚Äù next to your custom domain.
3. Remove the DNS records fro your domain provider.

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/custom-domain\#using-netlify)  Using Netlify

You can host on Netlify for free with a custom domain.

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/custom-domain\#step-by-step-guide-2)  Step-by-Step Guide

1

Step 1

Ensure that your project is successfully transferred to GitHub. In the Lovable editor, click on ‚ÄúTransfer to GitHub‚Äù located in the top right corner.

2

Step 2

Head over to Netlify and log in using your GitHub credentials.

3

Step 3

In Netlify, you‚Äôll need to follow these simple steps: Click on ‚ÄúImport from Git‚Äù > Authorize Netlify to access your GitHub repositories > Select your Lovable repository from the provided list > Click ‚ÄúDeploy‚Äù

4

Step 4

Let‚Äôs proceed to configure your custom domain directly within Netlify: Go to ‚ÄúDomain Management‚Äù > Click ‚ÄúAdd a domain‚Äù > Enter your domain name > Click ‚ÄúVerify‚Äù > Follow the DNS configuration prompts

5

Step 5

Your Lovable app will automatically redeploy to Netlify whenever you make changes in Lovable.

You will need to bring an existing domain or purchase one.

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/custom-domain\#using-vercel)  Using Vercel

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/custom-domain\#step-by-step-guide-3)  Step-by-Step Guide

1

Create a Github repository

Open your project in Lovable and click GitHub then ‚Äúcreate repository‚Äù if you haven‚Äôt already done so. This will commit your code to the `main` branch and create a repository. Once you do this, all changes made to code in your app will automatically be commited to your Github repository on each change.

2

Set up Vercel

Go to the [Vercel website](https://vercel.com/) and create an account. Configure your domain and set the necessary GitHub permissions (make sure to handle DNS settings properly).

3

Automatic deployments

Vercel will automatically deploy the latest changes from the `main` branch each time it is updated. You can make one or two small changes to your app on Lovable and then visit Vercel deployments to ensure updates are being redeployed from `main`. Once confirmed, do the next step:

4

Create a Development branch

In your GitHub repository settings in Lovable, commit all new changes to a second branch called `dev` (or whatever you want).

5

Configure Vercel Builds

Go back to Vercel and adjust your settings to ensure it only builds production deployments from the `main` branch.

6

Make changes in Development

Work on your app in the Lovable. Any changes will go to the `dev` branch now and wont automatically be deployed via Vercel.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08f6cd18-5d12-44da-a2cf-c07687eeab44)

7

Deploy new changes

When you‚Äôre ready to push new changes to your domain, go to GitHub and perform a pull request from `dev` to `main`. Once you complete and merge the pull request, Vercel will automatically deploy the updates in about one minute.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77244d5d-f9e1-4e5b-b372-5e1ea4003d63)

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/custom-domain\#notes)  Notes

- If you hit the 100/day deployment limit in Vercel (it builds your `dev` branch but doesn‚Äôt deploy it). You can ask Lovable chat to build you vercel.json file which will force Vercel to not build development builds at all.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b29581f-0942-432b-af30-71be43a921db)

- **Supabase Consideration**: Currently, you can only utilize one Supabase instance. So, if you make extensive SQL changes, it could potentially break production. Unfortunately, we can‚Äôt yet provide specific guidelines for this scenario as it‚Äôs complex. Frequently test your production environment if you make changes related to Supabase.


## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/custom-domain\#using-namecheap)  Using Namecheap

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/custom-domain\#step-by-step-guide-4)  Step-by-Step Guide

1

Transfer Your Lovable Project to GitHub

First, you need to transfer your Lovable project to GitHub if you haven‚Äôt already done so.

In your Lovable project, click on the ‚ÄúTransfer to GitHub‚Äù button at the top of the interface.

This step is required before proceeding with the custom domain setup.

2

Purchase a Domain from Namecheap

Start by acquiring your domain (e.g.,¬†mysimpledomain.com) from [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/).

3

Access Advanced DNS Settings

Navigate to the [Advanced DNS](https://ap.www.namecheap.com/Domains/DomainControlPanel/mysimpledomain.com/advancedns) settings for your domain.

4

Configure DNS Records

Add the following DNS records to your domain configuration:

![DNS record](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lovable-f9060f1e/images/dns-record.png)

5

Set Up GitHub Workflow

Create a GitHub workflow file for deployment:

Copy

```
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'

      - run: npm install

      - run: npm run build

      - name: Copy index.html to 404.html
        run: cp dist/index.html dist/404.html

      - name: Debug build output
        run: |
          echo "Listing contents of the root directory..."
          ls -la
          echo "Listing contents of the dist directory..."
          ls -R dist

      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GH_PAT }}
          publish_dir: ./dist
          cname: mysimpledomain.com
          force_orphan: true
```

6

Generate GitHub Access Token

Create a classic token at [GitHub](https://github.com/settings/tokens):

Keep the token page open‚Äîyou‚Äôll need it for the next step.

7

Add Repository Secret

Add your token as a repository secret named¬†`GH_PAT`.

8

Configure GitHub Pages

Navigate to your repository‚Äôs GitHub Pages settings and:

- Select¬†Build from a branch
- Choose the¬†gh-pages¬†branch
- Save the settings

9

Run the GitHub Workflow

Your website will be updated each time you run the GitHub workflow:

1. Go to your repository‚Äôs Actions page
2. Select the¬†Deploy to GitHub Pages¬†workflow
3. Click¬†Run workflow¬†button
4. This will publish the latest version of your GitHub repository to your custom domain

10

You're All Set! üéâ

Your Lovable app is now available on your custom domain.

Tips & tricks

Using Custom (Google) Fonts

Currently, Lovable does not support direct uploads of custom fonts.

However, there are several easy ways to use web-safe or incorporate custom fonts into your projects. Below, we‚Äôll guide you through the available methods for **using web-safe** and **Google fonts**:

Using a web-safe font

**What are web-safe fonts?**

Web-safe fonts are fonts that are commonly installed on most operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux, etc.) and are visible on all devices.

These fonts ensure that your text looks consistent across different browsers and platforms without needing to load any external resources. Some of the common web-safe fonts are:

- Arial/Helvetica
- Times New Roman
- Georgia
- Courier New
- Verdana
- Tahoma
- Trebuchet MS
- Lucida Sans Unicode

If you want to use a web-safe font in your project, you can specify the font directly in your prompt. For example, if you want to use **Courier New** for a heading or title in the hero section, simply reference the font by name in your prompt.

Copy

```
Use Courier New as the heading font in the hero section for the main title.
```

Web-safe fonts like Courier New ensure that your project will have consistent typography across all platforms without requiring external resources to load the font. However, they can limit your creativity. Lucikly, there are otions like the ability to use Google Fonts.

Using Google Fonts

If you prefer to use custom fonts, Lovable works nicely with **Google Fonts**. This allows you to easily use a wide range of fonts in your project. You can either reference a Google font by name or by linking directly to the font resource.

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/custom-fonts\#using-by-name)  Using by name

In your prompt, you can specify the name of a Google font, and Lovable will include it in your project. For example:

Copy

```
Use Playfair Display as the first subtitle title font in the hero section.

Make sure to use the useEffect React hook to apply the font properly.
```

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/custom-fonts\#using-by-link)  Using by link

Alternatively, you can provide a direct link to the Google font, and Lovable will use that font in your project. You can get the link from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) by selecting the desired font and copying the link.

Here‚Äôs how to prompt Lovable to use a Google font via a link:

Copy

```
Add this Google font link https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Dancing+Script
and use this font for the third subtitle.

Make sure to load the font using the useEffect React hook.
```

By following these methods, you can customize the typography of your Lovable project using either web-safe fonts or Google Fonts.

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/custom-fonts\#further-learning-and-examples)  Further learning and examples

To see these font integration methods in action, you can explore one of our example projects: [Lovable using fonts example project](https://lovable.dev/projects/3a826f38-d9cb-4d60-b4da-30a9b00149c8).

In this project, you‚Äôll find real prompts demonstrating how we applied different font styles, including web-safe fonts like Courier New and custom fonts from Google Fonts.

![Different fonts used in Lovable project](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lovable-f9060f1e/assets/using-custom-fonts-example.png)

Additionally, for a more technical look at how fonts were integrated, check out this public repository: [GitHub: adding-fonts-example](https://github.com/viborc/adding-fonts-example). It includes the full implementation details, showcasing how various fonts were loaded and applied in the project.

Tips & tricks

Mobile Support

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/mobile-store\#workaround-playbook)  Workaround Playbook

This is the playbook for publishing a Lovable Web App to Both App Stores, Apple App Store and Google Play Store:

This is a workaround, nothing official on our side or native integration for mobile support.

You can request the official feature [here](https://feedback.lovable.dev/p/mobile-app-stack).

1

Prepping the App

1

Step 1

Finalize the app‚Äôs UI and features inside Lovable.dev, ensuring everything functioned smoothly on different devices.

2

Step 2

Conduct multiple tests to check responsiveness and performance.

2

Setting Up Developer Accounts

- **Apple App Store:** Register for an Apple Developer Account ($99/year), configured necessary certificates, provisioning profiles, and App IDs.
- **Google Play Store:** Set up a Google Play Developer Account ($25 one-time fee), ensuring proper API access and compliance.

3

Converting the Web App for Submission

Use a web-to-native wrapper to package the Lovable web app for app store submission.

- For iOS, use Xcode to meet Apple‚Äôs strict submission guidelines.
- For Android, work with Android Studio to test and prepare the app for Play Store approval.

4

Submitting to the App Stores

Create detailed App Store and Play Store listings, including descriptions, screenshots, keywords, and privacy policies.

- Apple‚Äôs review process took 48-72 hours before approval.
- Google Play approval was much faster‚Äîless than 24 hours.

5

Post-Launch Optimization

- Monitore app performance and user feedback to ensure everything ran smoothly.
- Implement updates and optimizations for better discoverability and engagement.

The process has its challenges, especially with Apple‚Äôs strict guidelines and broken link setback, but it is all worth it in the end\\!

Lovable definitely made the process smoother.

Prompt Engineering

Debugging Prompts

Building with AI is fast and fun ‚Äì until something goes wrong. Errors, unexpected behaviors, or ‚Äúthe AI did something weird‚Äù moments are part of the process. This guide will help you navigate **AI-based debugging workflows in Lovable**. We‚Äôll cover how to quickly fix simple issues, strategies for tougher bugs, using Lovable‚Äôs chat for debugging, and even prompt recipes to systematically squash bugs. Debugging with an AI assistant is a new skill, but with structure and the right prompts, you can resolve problems efficiently and even turn them into learning opportunities.

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/prompting-debugging\#advanced-debugging-prompts)  Advanced Debugging Prompts

Sometimes you need a heavy-duty prompt to dig into a problem or review your project‚Äôs health. Here are some structured prompt examples for deep debugging or optimization scenarios. These can be used in Chat mode to get a thorough analysis without immediately changing code.

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/prompting-debugging\#full-system-review-codebase-audit)  Full System Review (Codebase Audit)

If your project has grown large or you suspect there are structural issues, a full codebase audit prompt can be useful. This asks the AI to analyze the entire project for cleanliness, correct architecture, and any misplaced code. It‚Äôs like asking ‚ÄúIs everything organized the way it should be?‚Äù

**Example Prompt ‚Äì Codebase Audit:**

Copy

```
Perform a comprehensive **audit of the entire codebase** to check if the architecture is clean, modular, and optimized:

- Identify any files, components, or logic that are in the wrong place or could be better organized. Are there any instances of code that don‚Äôt belong in their current file (misplaced logic)?
- Evaluate if we have a clear separation of concerns (e.g., data handling vs UI vs state management). Point out any overly coupled sections of code.
- Highlight any areas of the code that are overly complex or not following best practices.
- Provide a report with specific recommendations to improve structure and maintainability, **without making any code changes yet**.

Break down the suggestions into an ordered list of steps we could take, from most critical to optional enhancements.

*(This is a read-only analysis; do not modify the code during this audit.)*
```

This prompt is long, but it directs the AI to act like a code reviewer or architect. We‚Äôve asked it to find mislocated code, check modularity, and even prioritize the fixes‚Äã. The AI might respond with something like:

- \_‚Äú1. **Separate API calls from components:** The \_ `ProjectList` _component is directly fetching data. Suggestion: move data fetching to a dedicated hook or context to keep components pure UI.‚Äã_

1. **Reduce coupling in Task logic:** The task completion toggle is updating both state and directly writing to localStorage. This should be refactored to have a single source of truth.‚Äã
2. **Organize utility functions:** There are utility functions in `App.tsx` that would be better placed in a `utils` folder (e.g., date formatting functions).
3. ‚Ä¶‚Äù\*

Each point might come with explanation and maybe references to specific files. Such a report helps you see the forest for the trees. It‚Äôs especially useful if you‚Äôve been focusing on one feature at a time and haven‚Äôt looked at the overall structure in a while.

Avoid generic and broad prompts

Copy

```
Nothing works, fix it!
```

Make your prompts more detailed and specific

Copy

```
Now the screen has gone blank and I am no longer able to make edits.
Can you check what happened?
```

After getting this output, you can decide which refactoring tasks to tackle (maybe even prompt the AI to implement some of those recommendations one by one).

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/prompting-debugging\#safe-approach-for-fragile-updates)  Safe Approach for Fragile Updates

When you know the area you‚Äôre changing is delicate (maybe a complex authentication flow or a core algorithm), it‚Äôs wise to prepend a _cautionary guideline_ in your prompt. This doesn‚Äôt find bugs per se, but it helps prevent them by telling the AI to be extra careful. We saw an example in the Prompt Library section for locking files. Here‚Äôs a similar pattern focusing on not breaking things.

**Example Prompt ‚Äì Fragile Update Guidance:**

Copy

```
The next change is in a **critical part of the app**, so proceed with **utmost caution**.

- Carefully examine all related code and dependencies *before* making changes.
- **Avoid any modifications** to unrelated components or files.
- If there‚Äôs any uncertainty, pause and explain your thought process before continuing.
- Ensure thorough testing after the change to confirm nothing else is affected.

**Task:** Update the user authentication logic to support OAuth login via Google, on top of existing email/password without breaking either flow.

*(Be extremely careful and double-check each step during implementation.)*
```

By including the italicized guidelines and bold warnings, you‚Äôre basically setting the AI‚Äôs ‚Äúmindset‚Äù to be cautious‚Äã. The AI might then take a more measured approach, e.g., first explaining what it will do, or implementing the OAuth addition while explicitly noting that it left the email/password intact. This prompt doesn‚Äôt output a solution immediately; rather, it influences _how_ the AI will perform the task to minimize introducing new bugs.

This strategy is useful for **fragile sections**: authentication, payment processing, data migration ‚Äì anything where a small mistake can break a lot. It‚Äôs a preemptive debugging measure.

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/prompting-debugging\#performance-optimization-check)  Performance Optimization Check

If your app works correctly but is **slow** or resource-heavy, you can use a prompt to have the AI analyze performance. This might involve reviewing data fetching patterns, looking at rendering inefficiencies, or suggesting optimizations (caching, memoization, etc.). It‚Äôs like asking, ‚ÄúHow can we make this faster and smoother?‚Äù

**Example Prompt ‚Äì Performance Audit:**

Copy

```
Our app is functional but seems **sluggish**. Please **analyze the project for performance bottlenecks** and suggest optimizations:

- Check for any unnecessary database or network calls (e.g., duplicate fetches or N+1 query patterns).
- Identify components that might be re-rendering too often or doing heavy work on the main thread.
- Look at our use of assets (images, scripts): are there any large bundles or unoptimized assets affecting load time?
- Suggest improvements like caching frequently used data, using React memo or lazy loading where appropriate, and any other ways to speed up the app.

Provide the analysis and recommendations in a list. Do not make code changes yet ‚Äì just tell us what to improve for better performance.
```

Running this in Chat mode will give you a diagnostic report. The AI might say for example:

- _‚ÄúData fetching:_ The `ProjectList` component fetches data on every render. This could be improved by caching or moving the fetch to a higher context so it doesn‚Äôt repeat unnecessarily‚Äã. Consider using a state or context to store projects once fetched.
- _Re-renders:_ The `TaskItem` component is not memoized and re-renders every time any parent state changes. If we have many tasks, this can slow down interactions. Suggestion: use `React.memo` for `TaskItem` to prevent needless re-renders‚Äã.
- _Assets:_ Noticed an image (logo) that is 2MB. That‚Äôs quite large; compress or use a smaller resolution for faster loading.
- _Bundle size:_ All pages are in one bundle. Consider code-splitting (dynamic `import()` for large modules) so initial load is faster.
- ‚Ä¶‚Äù\*

Each suggestion comes from common performance best practices‚Äã. You can then decide which ones to implement. Maybe you prompt Lovable to apply one of them: _‚ÄúImplement caching for project data using context as suggested.‚Äù_ By addressing these, you improve user experience and possibly reduce costs (fewer calls, less computation).

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/prompting-debugging\#handling-persistent-errors)  Handling Persistent Errors

What about errors that just won‚Äôt go away or keep coming back in slight variations? This can happen if the root cause isn‚Äôt addressed. For example, you fix one thing, but the underlying problem surfaces as a new error elsewhere. Here‚Äôs a strategy for that:

- **Ask the AI what it has tried already.** Sometimes after a few ‚ÄúTry to Fix‚Äù attempts or manual prompts, it‚Äôs unclear what‚Äôs been changed. Use: \_‚ÄúWhat solutions have we tried so far for this error?‚Äù\_‚Äã. The AI can list the attempts, which helps you avoid repeating the same fixes.
- **Have the AI explain the error in simple terms.** _‚ÄúExplain in simple terms why this error occurs.‚Äù_ This can reveal if the AI (and you) truly understand it. You might catch a misconception here.
- **Consider an alternate approach.** Ask: \_‚ÄúGiven this error keeps happening, can we try a different approach to achieve the goal?‚Äù\_‚Äã. The AI might suggest a different implementation strategy that bypasses the problematic area.
- **Revert and replay.** In worst-case scenarios, you might roll back a few steps (Lovable lets you restore older versions). Then proceed with smaller changes. You can even tell the AI: _‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to undo the last changes and try a more incremental approach.‚Äù_ This resets the context a bit and often avoids the rut you were in.

Finally, if a specific component is ‚Äúdead‚Äù (not working at all, no matter what), isolate it. Create a fresh minimal version of that component via prompt to see if it works, then slowly integrate it back into your project. This is akin to turning things off and on again, but with code ‚Äì sometimes starting fresh on a piece is easier than trying to patch an overly broken one.

Throughout all this, maintain a dialogue with the AI. Treat it like a collaborator: _‚ÄúWe fixed X but now Y is acting up. What‚Äôs the relationship between X and Y? Could the fix have caused Y‚Äôs issue?‚Äù_ The AI might make connections you didn‚Äôt see.

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/prompting-debugging\#sample-debugging-flows)  Sample Debugging Flows

To cement these ideas, let‚Äôs walk through two common debugging scenarios with example flows:

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/prompting-debugging\#the-%E2%80%9Cstuck-in-error-loop-%E2%80%9D)  The ‚Äústuck in error loop.‚Äù

You prompted something complex, and now the app won‚Äôt build, and Try to Fix failed twice.

_Flow:_

1

You switch to Chat mode.

2

You ask, ‚ÄúWhat is the root cause of this build error?‚Äù

3

The AI explains it‚Äôs a type mismatch in the API call.

4

You then say, ‚ÄúShow me the relevant code and the expected types.‚Äù

5

AI shows that the function expected an ID number but got an object.

6

Now that you see it, you prompt, ‚ÄúAdjust the code to pass just the numeric ID to the function, not the whole object.‚Äù

7

Switch to Default, run that prompt, build succeeds.

8

If it didn‚Äôt, you‚Äôd go back, maybe ask ‚ÄúWhat else could cause this?‚Äù etc.

Throughout, you specifically described the error and had the AI confirm its understanding, rather than just blindly hitting fix repeatedly.

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/prompting-debugging\#the-%E2%80%9Cfeature-not-working-right-%E2%80%9D)  The ‚Äúfeature not working right.‚Äù

You added a notification feature, but emails aren‚Äôt sending.

_Flow:_

1

No error shows, so you ask in Chat, ‚ÄúThe email notification isn‚Äôt working ‚Äì I expected an email when a task is overdue, but got nothing. How can we debug this?‚Äù

2

AI suggests checking if the server function triggered and if the email service response had an error.

3

You grab the server log (perhaps from Supabase) and see a permission error.

4

You show this to the AI: ‚ÄúThe log says ‚Äòpermission denied when trying to send email.‚Äô‚Äù

5

AI figures out maybe the API key for the email service wasn‚Äôt set or the service blocked it.

6

You then fix the API key in settings (outside of Lovable) or prompt to adjust the function to use a different method.

Essentially, by describing what you expect (an email) and what happened (nothing, with a log snippet), the AI was able to guide the investigation.

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/prompting-debugging\#the-%E2%80%9Cui-element-disappeared-%E2%80%9D)  The ‚ÄúUI element disappeared.‚Äù

You refactored something and now a whole section of the UI is just gone (a ‚Äúdead component‚Äù).

_Flow:_

1

You tell the AI, ‚ÄúThe project list section is no longer showing up at all. It was working before the last edit.‚Äù

2

The AI might check if the component is still being rendered or if a return statement is missing.

Perhaps it realizes the refactor removed the `ProjectList` from the parent‚Äôs JSX. It suggests to re-import and include it. Or maybe state changes in a parent mean the list is now filtered out unintentionally.

3

The AI could walk through possibilities: ‚ÄúIs the data still being fetched? Is the component getting the data? Let‚Äôs add a console.log in the render to see if it‚Äôs receiving props.‚Äù

4

You do that (or the AI does via prompt), and see nothing logs ‚Äì meaning the component isn‚Äôt mounted.

Aha\\\! So you prompt, \_‚ÄúRestore the \_ `<ProjectList>` _in the Dashboard page JSX (it was accidentally removed).‚Äù_ Problem solved.

In this flow, the key was to notice the component was completely gone and communicate that. The AI helped pinpoint _why_ (not rendered vs rendered but empty, etc.).

Using Dev tools and console logs

Copy

```
My app is not working anymore and the screen is blank.
Here's the copy/paste from Dev tools console, can you fix the issue?

Error occurred:
TypeError: Q9() is undefined  at https://example.lovable.app/assets/index-DWQbrtrQQj.js
: 435 : 39117 index-DWQbrtrQQj.js:435:35112
onerror https://example.lovable.app/assets/index-DWQbrtrQQj.js:435
```

In all these cases, _communication and incremental steps_ are your friends. Use the AI‚Äôs strength in recalling details (like what it did before) and analyzing logs or errors. And use your strength in steering the process ‚Äì you understand the high-level goal and can decide when to try a different angle.

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/prompting-debugging\#root-cause-analysis%2C-rollback%2C-and-progressive-enhancement)  Root Cause Analysis, Rollback, and Progressive Enhancement

A few final pieces of advice:

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/prompting-debugging\#root-cause-vs-symptom)  Root Cause vs. Symptom

Always ask ‚Äúwhy did this happen?‚Äù not just ‚Äúwhat to do now?‚Äù. The AI can help find the root cause so that when you fix something, it stays fixed. For example, an AI quick fix might silence an error but not address the underlying logic bug. If you suspect that, dig deeper:

_I see you fixed the null pointer error by adding a check, but why was it null in the first place? Can we address that cause?_

This leads to more robust solutions.

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/prompting-debugging\#rollback-wisely%3A)  **Rollback wisely:**

Lovable allows you to roll back to previous versions. Don‚Äôt hesitate to use that if the code has become too tangled by a series of bad fixes. It‚Äôs often faster to rewind and try a different approach. If you do rollback, let the AI know what you‚Äôre doing (so it doesn‚Äôt get confused by code that suddenly looks different). For instance:

_I reverted the project to before the notifications feature. Let‚Äôs implement it again, but more carefully this time._

This way, the AI has context that we undid some changes and are taking another shot.

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/prompting-debugging\#progressive-enhancement%3A)  **Progressive enhancement:**

When adding new features (especially complex ones), build them in small, testable increments. This isn‚Äôt just a prompting tip ‚Äì it‚Äôs a development philosophy that pairs well with AI. If something breaks, you know exactly which small step caused it. Prompt by prompt, you enhance the app, which also means prompt by prompt you can debug in isolation. If you ever find yourself writing a paragraph-long prompt with multiple feature changes at once, consider splitting it into multiple prompts. You‚Äôll thank yourself later when troubleshooting is needed.

1. Add failing test cases.
2. Isolate the problem and analyze dependencies.
3. Document findings before applying fixes.

Copy

```
Here's the failing console log. Analyze the test case, investigate the error in auth flow, and suggest a solution after understanding the dependencies.
```

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/prompting-debugging\#document-as-you-go%3A)  **Document as you go:**

It‚Äôs helpful to keep notes (or even ask the AI to summarize what was done after a session). This is similar to the reverse meta prompting ‚Äì it creates a history of fixes. E.g., after resolving a tough bug, you might prompt:

_Summarize what the issue was and how we fixed it._

The AI‚Äôs summary can be saved in a `README` or log. This is great for future you, or anyone else on the project, to understand what happened.

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/prompting-debugging\#know-when-to-ask-for-human-help%3A)  **Know when to ask for human help:**

Sometimes, despite all efforts, you might hit a wall (maybe a true bug in the Lovable platform or something outside your/AI control). The Lovable community and support are there for you. There‚Äôs no shame in reaching out on their Discord or forums with a question. Often, others have faced a similar issue. Use the AI to gather as much info as possible first (so you can provide details), and then ask the community if needed.

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/prompting-debugging\#community-debugging-guidebook)  Community Debugging Guidebook

This guidebook was shared in our community Discord‚Äîit might be useful for debugging your project:

Error Fixing

When fixing errors, focus exclusively on the relevant code sections without modifying unrelated functioning parts. Analyze the error message and trace it to its source. Implement targeted fixes that address the specific issue while maintaining compatibility with the existing codebase. Before confirming any solution, validate that it resolves the original problem without introducing new bugs. Always preserve working functionality and avoid rewriting code that isn‚Äôt directly related to the error.

Code Modification Approach

When modifying existing code, use a surgical approach that changes only what‚Äôs necessary to implement the requested feature or fix. Preserve variable names, coding patterns, and architectural decisions present in the codebase. Before suggesting changes, analyze dependencies to ensure modifications won‚Äôt break existing functionality. Present changes as minimal diffs rather than complete rewrites. When improvements beyond the immediate task are identified, suggest them separately without implementing them automatically.

Database Integration

Before suggesting new database structures, thoroughly examine the existing schema to identify tables, relationships, and fields already present. Leverage existing tables whenever possible rather than duplicating data models. When modifications to the database are necessary, ensure they‚Äôre compatible with existing queries and data access patterns. Consider migration strategies for schema changes that preserve existing data. Always verify foreign key relationships and data integrity constraints before proposing changes.

Thorough Issue Analysis

Approach every issue with a comprehensive diagnostic process. Begin by gathering all relevant information through careful examination of error messages, logs, and system behavior. Form multiple hypotheses about potential causes rather than jumping to conclusions. Test each hypothesis methodically until the root cause is identified. Document your analysis process and findings before proposing solutions. Consider potential edge cases and how they might affect the system.

Solution Verification

Before confirming any solution, implement a rigorous verification process. Test the solution against the original issue to confirm it resolves the problem. Check for unintended side effects in related functionality. Ensure performance isn‚Äôt negatively impacted. Verify compatibility with different environments and configurations. Run through edge cases to ensure robustness. Only after completing this verification should you present the solution as confirmed.

Code Consistency

Maintain consistency with the existing codebase in terms of style, patterns, and approaches. Analyze the code to identify naming conventions, formatting preferences, and architectural patterns. Follow these established patterns when implementing new features or fixes. Use the same error handling strategies, logging approaches, and testing methodologies present in the project. This preserves readability and maintainability while reducing the cognitive load for developers.

Progressive Enhancement

When adding new features, build upon the existing architecture rather than introducing completely new paradigms. Identify extension points in the current design and leverage them for new functionality. Implement changes that align with the established patterns and principles of the codebase. Focus on backward compatibility to ensure existing features continue to work as expected. Document how new additions integrate with and extend the existing system.

Documentation and Explanation

Provide clear, concise explanations for all changes and recommendations. Explain not just what changes are being made, but why they‚Äôre necessary and how they work. Document any assumptions or dependencies involved in the solution. Include comments in code when introducing complex logic or non-obvious solutions. When suggesting architectural changes, provide diagrams or high-level explanations that help visualize the impact.

Technical Debt Awareness

Recognize when solutions might introduce technical debt and be transparent about these trade-offs. When time constraints necessitate less-than-ideal solutions, clearly identify what aspects would benefit from future refactoring. Distinguish between quick fixes and proper solutions, recommending the appropriate approach based on context. When technical debt is unavoidable, document it clearly to facilitate future improvements.

Learning and Adaptation

Continuously adapt to the project‚Äôs specific patterns and preferences. Pay attention to feedback on previous suggestions and incorporate these learnings into future recommendations. Build a mental model of the application architecture that becomes increasingly accurate over time. Remember past issues and solutions to avoid repeating mistakes. Actively seek to understand the underlying business requirements driving technical decisions.

Preventing Duplicate Components

Before creating new pages, components, or flows, conduct a thorough inventory of existing elements in the codebase. Search for similar functionality using relevant keywords and file patterns. Identify opportunities to reuse or extend existing components rather than creating duplicates. When similar features exist, analyze them to understand if they can be parameterized or adapted instead of duplicated. Maintain a mental model of the application‚Äôs structure to recognize when proposed solutions might create redundant elements. When similar pages or flows are needed, consider creating abstracted components that can be reused with different data or configurations, promoting DRY (Don‚Äôt Repeat Yourself) principles.

Dead Code Elimination

Actively identify and remove unused code rather than letting it accumulate. When replacing functionality, cleanly remove the old implementation instead of simply commenting it out or leaving it alongside new code. Before deleting code, verify its usage throughout the application by checking for imports and references. Use tools like dependency analysis when available to confirm code is truly unused. When refactoring, track deprecated methods and ensure they‚Äôre properly removed once no longer referenced. Regularly scan for orphaned components, unused imports, commented-out blocks, and unreachable conditions. When suggesting code removal, provide clear reasoning for why it‚Äôs considered dead code and confirm there are no subtle dependencies before deletion. Maintain cleanliness in the codebase by prioritizing elimination of code paths that are no longer executed.

Preserving Working Features

Treat working features as locked systems that require explicit permission to modify. Before suggesting changes to any functioning component, clearly identify its boundaries and dependencies. Never remove or substantially alter features that are currently operational without explicit direction. When errors occur in one area, avoid making ‚Äújust in case‚Äù changes to unrelated working components. Maintain a clear understanding of which parts of the application are stable and which are under development. Use a feature-focused approach where changes are isolated to specific feature sets without bleeding into others. When modifying shared components used by multiple features, ensure all dependent features continue functioning as expected. Create safeguards by thoroughly documenting cross-feature dependencies before making modifications that might affect them. Always explicitly confirm intent before suggesting changes to established, functional parts of the application.

Deep Problem-Solving Approach

When encountering complex errors, resist the temptation to apply immediate fixes without deeper understanding. Take a deliberate step back to examine the problem from multiple perspectives before proposing solutions. Consider fundamentally different approaches rather than minor variations of the same strategy. Document at least three potential solutions with their pros and cons before recommending a specific approach. Question initial assumptions about the cause of errors, especially when standard fixes don‚Äôt work. Consider unconventional sources of issues such as environment configurations, external dependencies, or race conditions that might not be immediately obvious. Try reversing your thinking: instead of asking ‚Äúwhy isn‚Äôt this working?‚Äù, ask ‚Äúunder what conditions would this behavior actually make sense?‚Äù. Break complex problems into smaller components that can be verified independently. Implement targeted debugging strategies such as logging, breakpoints, or state tracing to gather more information when the source of an error remains unclear. Be willing to propose experimental fixes as learning opportunities rather than definitive solutions when dealing with particularly obscure issues.

Database Query Verification

Before suggesting any database query or schema modification, always verify the current state of the database first. Examine existing tables, fields, and relationships to ensure you‚Äôre not recommending the creation of elements that already exist. When suggesting queries, first check if similar queries exist in the codebase that can be adapted. Review existing data models, migration files, and schema definitions to build an accurate understanding of the database structure. For any proposed table creation, explicitly confirm that the table doesn‚Äôt already exist and explain why a new table is necessary rather than modifying an existing one. When suggesting field additions, verify that similar fields don‚Äôt already serve the same purpose under different names. Consider database performance implications of suggested queries and provide optimized alternatives when appropriate. Always contextualize query suggestions within the existing database architecture rather than treating them as isolated operations.

UI Consistency and Theming

Maintain strict adherence to the established design system and color palette throughout the application. Before creating new UI components, study existing ones to understand the visual language, spacing patterns, interaction models, and theming approach. When implementing new interfaces, reuse existing component patterns rather than creating visual variations. Extract color values, typography, spacing, and other design tokens from the existing codebase rather than introducing new values. Ensure consistent handling of states (hover, active, disabled, error, etc.) across all components. Respect the established responsive behavior patterns when implementing new layouts. When suggesting UI improvements, ensure they enhance rather than disrupt the visual cohesion of the application. Maintain accessibility standards consistently across all components, including color contrast ratios, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support. Document any component variations and their appropriate usage contexts to facilitate consistent application. When introducing new visual elements, explicitly demonstrate how they integrate with and complement the existing design system rather than standing apart from it.

Systematic Debugging Approach

When encountering errors, adopt a scientific debugging methodology rather than making random changes. Start by reproducing the exact issue in a controlled environment. Gather comprehensive data including console logs, network requests, component state, and error messages. Form multiple hypotheses about potential causes and test each systematically. Isolate the problem by narrowing down affected components and identifying trigger conditions. Document your debugging process and findings for future reference. Use appropriate debugging tools including browser developer tools, React DevTools, and code-level debugging techniques. Always verify that your solution completely resolves the issue without introducing new problems or regressions elsewhere in the application.

Type Safety and Data Validation

Before implementing any functionality, thoroughly analyze type definitions from both database schema and TypeScript interfaces. Maintain strict type checking throughout the codebase, avoiding ‚Äòany‚Äô type as an escape hatch. When working with data transformations, verify type safety at each step of the pipeline. Pay special attention to common type mismatches like database numbers coming in as strings, date parsing requirements, and handling of nullable fields. Implement consistent naming conventions between database columns and TypeScript interfaces. Document complex type relationships and special handling requirements. Test with real data shapes and verify edge cases, particularly null/undefined handling. When errors occur, trace the data transformation pipeline to identify exactly where types diverge and suggest fixes that maintain type safety.

Data Flow Management

Conceptualize data flow as a complete pipeline from database through API and state to UI. When implementing features, carefully track how data is transformed at each stage. Implement proper query invalidation patterns to ensure UI remains synchronized with database state. Add strategic console logs at critical points to monitor data transitions. Create clear mental models of when and how data should update in response to actions. Pay careful attention to caching strategies and potential stale data issues. When debugging flow problems, methodically follow the data journey from source to destination. Check timing issues, race conditions, and transformation errors. Verify that the final data shape reaching components matches what they expect. Implement robust error boundaries and loading state management to maintain UI stability during data flow disruptions.

Performance Optimization

Monitor application performance proactively rather than waiting for issues to become severe. Review query caching strategies to minimize unnecessary database calls. Check for and eliminate unnecessary component re-renders through proper memoization and dependency management. Analyze data fetching patterns for potential N+1 query problems, excessive waterfalls, or redundant requests. Implement virtualization for long lists and paginate large data sets. Optimize bundle size through code splitting and lazy loading. Compress and optimize assets including images. Use appropriate performance measurement tools to identify bottlenecks including React DevTools, Performance tab, Network panel, and Memory profiler. Focus optimization efforts on metrics that directly impact user experience such as load times, time to interactive, and UI responsiveness. Implement targeted performance improvements rather than premature optimization.

Error Management and Resilience

Implement a comprehensive error handling strategy that maintains application stability while providing meaningful feedback. Use try/catch blocks strategically around potentially problematic code sections. Create a hierarchy of error boundaries to contain failures within specific components rather than crashing the entire application. Design graceful degradation patterns where components can continue functioning with limited data. Provide clear, user-friendly error messages that explain the problem without technical jargon. Implement recovery mechanisms including retry logic, fallbacks, and state resets. Maintain robust error logging that captures sufficient context for debugging while respecting privacy. Test error scenarios thoroughly to ensure recovery mechanisms work as expected. When suggesting solutions, ensure they address the root cause rather than merely suppressing symptoms, and verify they work across all relevant environments and edge cases.

Component Architecture

Approach component design with a clear understanding of component hierarchy and responsibilities. Visualize components as a family tree with proper parent-child relationships. Minimize prop drilling by strategically using context or state management where appropriate. Implement clear boundaries between container (smart) and presentational (dumb) components. Establish consistent patterns for component communication including parent-child and sibling interactions. When debugging component issues, analyze the complete component tree, prop flow, state location, and event handler connections. Design components with single responsibility and clear interfaces. Document component relationships and dependencies to facilitate future maintenance. Implement performance optimizations including memoization, lazy loading, and code splitting where beneficial. Maintain a balance between component reusability and specialization to avoid both duplication and over-abstraction.

API Integration and Network Management

Approach API integration with a comprehensive strategy for requests, responses, and error handling. Verify authentication headers, parameters, and body format for each request. Implement proper error handling for all network operations with specific catches for different error types. Ensure consistent typing between request payloads, expected responses, and application state. Configure proper CORS settings and verify they work across all environments. Implement intelligent retry mechanisms for transient failures with exponential backoff. Consider rate limiting implications and implement appropriate throttling. Add strategic request caching to improve performance and reduce server load. Monitor network performance including request timing and payload sizes. Test API integrations against both happy paths and various failure scenarios. Maintain clear documentation of all API endpoints, their purposes, expected parameters, and response formats to facilitate future development and debugging.

Prompt Engineering

Prompt Library

_Welcome to the prompt library\\!_ Here we‚Äôve collected a set of reusable prompt patterns and examples for common scenarios when building with AI. Think of these as templates or inspiration that you can tailor to your own project. Each section covers a particular use case ‚Äì from kicking off a new project to integrating payments ‚Äì with guidance on when to use it and an example prompt.

Feel free to copy these, modify the details, and use them in Lovable or any AI builder. The tone is official yet casual ‚Äì just like talking to a colleague ‚Äì and each prompt provides enough context so the AI knows exactly what to do.

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/prompting-library\#starting-projects)  Starting Projects

**When to use:** At the very beginning of a project. This prompt helps the AI understand the high-level requirements and start building the foundation. Use it to **kick off a new app** by specifying what you‚Äôre building, the tech stack, and core features. It‚Äôs your project brief.

**How to use:** Outline the type of application, key technologies (frontend framework, backend, any services), and the primary features or pages. Then, direct the AI on where to start (often the main page or an important feature). This establishes the project scope and initial focus.

**Example Prompt ‚Äì Starting a New Project:**

Copy

```
I need a **task management** application with:
- **Tech Stack:** Next.js frontend, Tailwind CSS for styling, Supabase for auth and database.
- **Core Features:** Project and task creation, assigning tasks to users, due date reminders, and a dashboard overview.

Start by building the **main dashboard page**, containing:
- A header with navigation,
- A list of projects with their status,
- and a button to create a new project.

Provide dummy data for now, and ensure the design is clean and responsive.
```

Copy

```
Create a new component called [ComponentName] with these features: [list features]. Make it responsive and accessible with proper keyboard navigation. Include proper TypeScript typings for props, and use Tailwind for styling.
```

Copy

```
Explain how this function works in simple terms, highlighting its inputs, outputs, and any side effects: [paste function]. What edge cases does it handle or miss? How could it be improved?
```

This prompt follows a proven structure for new projects‚Äã. It first states the app type and tech stack, then lists core features, and finally tells the AI where to begin (the main dashboard page, with specifics). By doing this, you give Lovable a clear roadmap to initiate the project. _(Pro tip: It‚Äôs often wise to start with an empty project and build up gradually, so the AI doesn‚Äôt get overwhelmed‚Äã.)_

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/prompting-library\#ui%2Fux-design)  UI/UX Design

**When to use:** Any time you want to **refine the look and feel** of your app without changing its functionality. This could be polishing the UI, adjusting layouts, or implementing a specific design style.

**How to use:** Clearly specify the scope of the design changes and emphasize that functionality should remain intact. The AI is quite good at styling, but you should guide it on what ‚Äúlook‚Äù you want (e.g. modern, minimalist, match a certain design system). If you have multiple changes, tackle them one at a time (e.g. first layout, then colors). Always mention if there are parts of the UI that must not be altered logic-wise.

Lovable has pretty good taste out of the box, but a targeted prompt can help achieve a specific aesthetic or UX improvement‚Äã. For example, you might want to restyle a button, improve form layout, or ensure consistency in spacing.

**Example Prompt ‚Äì UI Only Changes:**

Copy

```
The app UI should be improved, **without changing any functionality**.

- Keep all existing logic and state management as is.
- **Visual Enhancements:** Update the styling of the dashboard page: use a modern card design for each project listing, improve the color scheme for better contrast, and increase padding for a cleaner layout.
- Ensure these changes do **not break any functionality or data flow**.

*Goal:* purely cosmetic improvements for a more polished look, with the app behaving exactly as before.
```

Copy

```
Enhance the visual appeal of this component: [paste component]. Add animations, improve spacing, create a polished look while maintaining accessibility standards and responsive behavior.
```

Copy

```
Create a comprehensive design system for my application with a color palette, typography scale, spacing system, and component variants. Include dark mode support and ensure all components are accessible (WCAG AA compliant).
```

Copy

```
Design a responsive dashboard layout with [describe key metrics/widgets]. It should work well on mobile, tablet, and desktop with appropriate layout shifts. Include a sidebar navigation that collapses on mobile.
```

Copy

```
Transform this desktop-only component into a mobile-first design with responsive breakpoints: [paste component]. Prioritize content and interactions for small screens first, then enhance for larger screens.
```

Copy

```
Add subtle, performant animations to this component to enhance user experience: [paste component]. Include enter/exit animations, hover states, and micro-interactions that provide feedback without being distracting.
```

Copy

```
Analyze and optimize the user flow for [describe task/goal]. Map out each step of the journey, identify friction points, and suggest UI improvements to create a more intuitive experience with fewer steps.
```

Copy

```
Review these components for accessibility issues and suggest improvements: [paste components]. Check for proper keyboard navigation, screen reader support, sufficient color contrast, and appropriate ARIA attributes.
```

In this prompt, we explicitly say to make solely visual enhancements and not affect how the app works‚Äã. This is crucial ‚Äì it tells the AI ‚Äúdon‚Äôt touch the logic.‚Äù We list specifics (card design, color contrast, spacing) so the AI knows what aspects of the UI to tweak. This kind of prompt is perfect after you‚Äôve built features and want to beautify the interface.

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/prompting-library\#responsiveness)  Responsiveness

**When to use:** When your app‚Äôs layout needs to work across different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop). If you notice things look good on desktop but break on mobile, it‚Äôs time for a responsiveness prompt. It‚Äôs also wise to do this as a final pass on any UI-heavy task.

**How to use:** Emphasize a **mobile-first approach** and ask the AI to ensure the design is responsive at all standard breakpoints‚Äã. If using a CSS framework like Tailwind, mention to use its grid/flex and built-in breakpoints. You can also instruct the AI to avoid any fixed widths or anything that would prevent fluid resizing. Providing an example of what breaks on small screens (if you have one) can help, or simply say ‚Äúmake everything adapt to smaller screens gracefully.‚Äù

**Example Prompt ‚Äì Mobile Responsiveness:**

Copy

```
Our app needs to be **fully responsive** across mobile, tablet, and desktop.

- Follow a **mobile-first** strategy: prioritize the layout for small screens, then adjust for larger screens.
- Use modern UI/UX best practices for responsive design. (For Tailwind CSS, use the standard breakpoints `sm, md, lg, xl` ‚Äì no custom breakpoints unless necessary.)
- Ensure every page (especially the dashboard and project detail pages) reflows properly on a small screen: elements should stack or resize as needed, text should remain readable, and no content should overflow off-screen.
- **Do not change the core design or functionality**, just make sure it flexibly adapts to different screen sizes.

After making changes, please double-check the layout at iPhone 12 dimensions and a typical desktop width.
```

In this prompt, we explicitly instruct the AI to make all designs responsive at every breakpoint, focusing on mobile first‚Äã. We even reference Tailwind‚Äôs standard breakpoints to guide the implementation. We clarify that the design and functionality shouldn‚Äôt fundamentally change; it should just work well on smaller screens. This sets a clear expectation: the outcome should look the same design-wise, but fluidly resize and re-stack for responsiveness.

_(Using Lovable‚Äôs image upload? You could attach a screenshot of a broken mobile layout and ask: ‚ÄúMake it look like this on mobile.‚Äù Visual prompts can reinforce what you describe.)_

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/prompting-library\#refactoring)  Refactoring

**When to use:** Periodically during development, especially if the AI or you have added a lot of code and things are getting messy or slow. Refactoring means cleaning up the code without changing what it does ‚Äì improving structure, readability, or performance. Lovable might even suggest refactoring if it detects a lot of repeated patterns or long functions.

**How to use:** Identify the scope: is it a single file, a specific feature, or the whole codebase? For a single file or component, you can prompt something like ‚ÄúRefactor this file for clarity and efficiency, but **do not alter its functionality or output**.‚Äù Emphasize that everything should behave the same after refactoring‚Äã. If you want, specify what to focus on (e.g., reduce duplication, improve variable names, simplify logic). For larger-scale refactoring, it‚Äôs wise to ask the AI to **plan the refactor in steps** (see the next section on Planning) or audit the code structure first.

**Example Prompt ‚Äì Safe File Refactor:**

Copy

```
Refactor the **ProjectList component file**, but **keep its behavior and UI exactly the same**.

Goals:
- Improve the code structure and readability (simplify complex functions, break into smaller ones if needed).
- Remove any unused variables or imports.
- Ensure the file follows best practices and is well-documented.

Do **not** introduce any new features or change how the component works for the user ‚Äì this is purely a code cleanup for maintainability. If any part of the code is unclear, add a brief comment for clarification.
```

Copy

```
Review this code and suggest improvements for readability, performance, and maintainability: [paste code]. Focus on TypeScript best practices, proper error handling, and adherence to React patterns.
```

Copy

```
Suggest a folder structure for a [type] application with these features: [list features]. Include guidelines for organizing components, hooks, utilities, and types with proper separation of concerns.
```

Copy

```
I'm getting this error: [paste error]. Here's the relevant code: [paste code]. Can you help me understand what's causing it and how to fix it? Please explain why the solution works.
```

This prompt clearly states the component to refactor and the constraints (no functional changes allowed). It prioritizes structure and maintainability‚Äã. The AI will go through the file, maybe reordering functions, renaming things for clarity, commenting tricky parts, etc., but the output of the app should remain identical. This helps prevent the dreaded scenario of a ‚Äúrefactor‚Äù accidentally breaking something.

For bigger refactoring efforts (like many files or an entire project), consider having the AI **analyze the codebase first**. You can use a prompt to get a report on what could be improved and where (see the Debugging section‚Äôs _Full System Review_ prompt for an idea). Then, apply changes incrementally. Refactor in small pieces and test as you go, rather than one massive overhaul.

```

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/prompting-library\#locking-files-%2F-limiting-scope)  Locking Files / Limiting Scope

**When to use:** Sometimes you want the AI to focus on specific parts of the project and leave everything else untouched ‚Äì essentially ‚Äúlock‚Äù certain files or areas so they are not modified. This is useful if you‚Äôve manually written some code or have a stable component you don‚Äôt want altered while the AI works on something else. Since Lovable doesn‚Äôt have a literal file-lock feature yet, using the prompt to constrain scope is the next best thing.

**How to use:** In your prompt, **explicitly instruct the AI not to change** certain files or components. You might say, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt edit the authentication files,‚Äù or ‚ÄúKeep the HomePage component unchanged.‚Äù Also, be clear about where the AI _should_ focus changes. This directive should be included each time you prompt during that sensitive period, to remind the AI of the boundary.

**Example Prompt ‚Äì Limit Scope of Changes:**

Copy

```
Please **focus only on the Dashboard page** for this change.

- Do **not modify** the `LoginPage.tsx` or `AuthProvider.tsx` files at all (authentication is working well, and we want to keep it intact).
- Concentrate your code edits on `Dashboard.tsx` and related dashboard components **only**.

Task: Add a new section to the Dashboard that shows ‚ÄúTasks due this week‚Äù. Make sure to fetch the relevant tasks from the database.

*(Again, no changes to login or auth files ‚Äì those are off-limits.)*
```

Here we included a very direct constraint: \_‚Äúrefrain from altering pages X or Y and focus changes solely on page Z.‚Äù\_‚Äã. By repeating this in the prompt, we guide the AI‚Äôs attention. The task itself (adding a dashboard section) is given, but we wrapped it with instructions about scope. This greatly reduces the chance of Lovable tinkering with your login system while trying to add a dashboard feature.

Another scenario is when updating a very delicate feature. In such cases, you can combine scope limitation with a cautionary tone. For example: _**‚ÄúThis update is sensitive; proceed very carefully and avoid touching anything unrelated‚Äù**_. This was demonstrated in a prompt like: \_‚ÄúThis update is quite delicate‚Ä¶ Steer clear of shortcuts or assumptions ‚Äî take a moment to seek clarification if unsure. Precision is crucial.‚Äù\_‚Äã. Including a line like that sets the AI‚Äôs ‚Äúmindset‚Äù to be extra cautious.

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/prompting-library\#planning)  Planning

**When to use:** Before diving into a complex or multi-step implementation, or when you have a big feature that could be broken into sub-tasks. Planning prompts are also useful if you want the AI to outline an approach before writing code, so you can verify the plan (and adjust it) without burning through code-generation credits on a wrong path. Essentially, use this when the _strategy_ isn‚Äôt straightforward and you‚Äôd like the AI‚Äôs help to think it through.

**How to use:** Ask the AI to produce a plan or checklist. You can say, ‚ÄúOutline a step-by-step plan for X‚Äù or ‚ÄúBefore coding, list the steps you will take to implement Y.‚Äù This can be done in Chat mode to ensure it doesn‚Äôt execute any code changes while planning‚Äã. After getting the plan, you might even discuss it (maybe have the AI explain why each step is needed) and then proceed to implementation step by step. Planning prompts are meta ‚Äì they don‚Äôt build the app directly, but they set the stage for a smoother build.

**Example Prompt ‚Äì Planning a Feature Implementation:**

Copy

```
Before writing any code, **plan out the implementation** of the new Notifications feature.

- List each step required to add email notifications when a task is overdue.
- Consider both frontend (UI changes, if any) and backend (creating scheduled checks or triggers) aspects.
- Ensure the plan keeps the current functionality stable ‚Äì we can‚Äôt break anything existing.
- Provide the plan as an ordered list (1, 2, 3, ...), with a brief explanation of each step.

Once you outline the plan, pause for review. **Do not make any code changes yet.**
```

This prompt tells the AI to act as a planner. It asks for a sequenced plan to implement an ‚Äúemail notifications for overdue tasks‚Äù feature. We explicitly say not to code yet (so we‚Äôd run this in Chat mode or just trust that the AI will output a plan). The AI might respond with something like:

1. **Add a timestamp field** to tasks for due date (if not already present).
2. **Create a server-side function** (or scheduled job) to check for overdue tasks periodically.
3. **Integrate email sending** using an email service (e.g., Resend or SMTP) when an overdue task is found.
4. **Update the UI** to allow users to toggle notifications on/off for a task (optional setting).
5. **Test the flow** with a task that just passed its due time to ensure an email is sent.

By reviewing such a plan, you can catch any issues (maybe we realize we need a new DB table, or maybe step 4 is out-of-scope for now, etc.) _before_ any coding happens. It‚Äôs a lot easier to tweak the plan than to rewrite bad code. Planning prompts save time in complex features by getting the approach right from the start‚Äã.

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/prompting-library\#stripe-setup)  Stripe Setup

**When to use:** When you want to integrate payments into your app using Stripe. Lovable has integration points for Stripe, but it requires setting up keys, webhooks, and UI for checkout. A prompt can handle the boilerplate of connecting to Stripe‚Äôs API. Use this when you need to add commerce (selling a product, subscription, etc.) in your project.

**How to use:** Provide the details Stripe needs: mode (test or live), product or pricing info, and redirect URLs after payment. Also, instruct how the UI should behave (e.g., a checkout form/modal). It‚Äôs **crucial** to mention that sensitive keys will be provided securely (not hard-coded in the prompt)‚Äã ‚Äì you typically store those in environment variables or Lovable‚Äôs secret storage. So you can say ‚Äúassume I have set the API keys in the environment.‚Äù This way, the AI will know to call the keys, not include them literally. Additionally, specify _not_ to alter unrelated code while setting up Stripe (to avoid accidental changes).

**Example Prompt ‚Äì Integrating Stripe Payments:**

Copy

```
I want to **add Stripe payments** to the app.

- Use **Stripe in test mode** for now.
- We have a product in Stripe with ID `prod_12345` and a price ID `price_67890` (one-time purchase).
- Implement a checkout button on the **Pricing page** that starts a Stripe checkout for that product.
- After successful payment, redirect the user to `/payment-success`. If the payment is canceled, redirect to `/payment-cancelled`.

Important:
- Assume API keys and webhook secrets are configured securely (do **not** hard-code them).
- Do **not** modify any other pages or features unrelated to payments.

Once done, provide any webhook endpoint setup instructions I need (e.g., URL to add in Stripe dashboard for post-payment events).
```

This prompt gives all the key details for Stripe: test mode, product IDs, what happens on success/cancel, and where to put the checkout button. It explicitly says not to touch anything else. The AI (and Lovable‚Äôs Stripe integration helper) will use this to scaffold the Stripe integration. Under the hood, Lovable might create a serverless function (if using Supabase) to handle webhooks, etc., but you don‚Äôt have to prompt that separately ‚Äì the instruction here is usually enough for a basic setup‚Äã.

_Note:_ We included a line about API keys being secure because we never want secret keys in the prompt. The docs remind us: \_‚ÄúUse your Stripe Secret Key in the Supabase Edge Function secrets, and avoid including them in the prompt‚Äù\_‚Äã. So by telling the AI ‚Äúassume it‚Äôs configured,‚Äù you ensure the code will reference an environment variable or config, not a plaintext key.

After running this prompt, test the payment flow with Stripe‚Äôs test card numbers. If something isn‚Äôt working (e.g., the webhook), Lovable might show errors which you can then debug or refine with another prompt.

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/prompting-library\#using-chat-mode-vs-default-mode)  Using Chat Mode vs Default Mode

**When to use:** Lovable has two modes for prompting: **Default Mode** (which immediately applies changes to your project) and **Chat-Only Mode** (which is more like a conversation without altering code until you say so). Knowing when to use each can streamline your workflow. Use Default for straight coding tasks and use Chat mode for brainstorming, debugging, or when you want to discuss changes before executing them.

**How to use:**

- **Default Mode** is great for when you have a well-defined feature to build or change to make. You give the instruction, and Lovable will do it in one go if possible.
- **Chat Mode**, on the other hand, is useful if you want to have a back-and-forth or analyze something (like asking _‚ÄúWhy is this not working?‚Äù_ or _‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the best way to do X?‚Äù_) without immediately changing the codebase‚Äã. In Chat Mode, the AI will respond with analysis or a plan, and you usually have to explicitly say ‚Äúgo ahead and implement‚Äù when ready.

**Example use case ‚Äì Default vs Chat:**

Suppose you suspect there is outdated code in your project that needs cleaning up. In Default mode, you might directly prompt:

_Review the app and tell me where there is outdated code._

Lovable could try to both identify and possibly start refactoring it in one go‚Äã. But maybe you actually want to be careful and just get advice. In that case, you‚Äôd switch to Chat mode and ask something like:

_I‚Äôm seeing some deprecated library warnings. What parts of the code might be outdated, and how should we update them?_

Now the AI will _discuss_ this with you, rather than immediately rewriting files.

Similarly, if you have an error and you want the AI to analyze it, Chat mode is safer. You can copy an error message and ask:

_What does this error mean, and how can we fix it?_

The AI will explain and propose a solution. Once you agree, you might switch to Default mode or explicitly instruct to apply the fix.

In summary, **use Default Mode for straightforward building** (‚Äúdo X for me‚Äù), and **use Chat Mode for troubleshooting or design discussions** (‚Äúwhy or how should we do X?‚Äù). One concrete workflow is: _Brainstorm in Chat (get a plan or identify issues), then execute in Default._ This approach is even recommended: for example, \_use Chat Mode to have the AI analyze errors before making changes\_‚Äã. It‚Äôs like using ChatGPT for advice and then applying the changes once you‚Äôre confident.

_(Make sure Chat-Only Mode is enabled in your settings under Labs if you don‚Äôt see it‚Äã. This mode ensures the AI won‚Äôt write code to your project until you say so, which is perfect for safe experimentation.)_

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/prompting-library\#writing-knowledge-bases-and-prds)  Writing Knowledge Bases and PRDs

**When to use:** At the start of a project and whenever you have more context to give the AI than can fit in a single prompt. In Lovable, the **Knowledge Base** is a special place in your project settings where you can store background information, requirements, and guidelines that persist across prompts‚Äã. A **Project Requirements Document (PRD)** is a comprehensive summary of your app‚Äôs objectives and specs ‚Äì essentially, the blueprint of what you‚Äôre building. Use these tools to prevent misunderstanding and to anchor the AI with the big picture of your project.

**How to use:** Begin by filling out the Knowledge Base in Lovable with key info about your project. This can include:

- **Overview & Goals:** What the project is and the problem it solves.
- **User Flow:** A description of how users navigate or use the app (e.g. ‚ÄúUsers sign up, then see a dashboard, can create tasks, etc.‚Äù)‚Äã.
- **Core Features & Scope:** What features are in scope (and maybe note any out-of-scope to avoid feature creep)‚Äã.
- **Tech Stack:** What technologies, APIs, and services will be used‚Äã.
- **Design Guidelines:** Any specific UI/UX instructions ‚Äì branding, color scheme, layouts, accessibility requirements‚Äã.
- **Backend Details:** Outline data models, key database tables, integrations like Stripe or Supabase, etc.‚Äã..

This might sound like a lot, but writing it down pays off. **The AI will use this info on every prompt to stay aligned with your project‚Äôs needs‚Äã.** It‚Äôs like giving the AI long-term memory about your app. You typically set this up once (and update as needed).

After populating the knowledge base, you can literally tell the AI to use it. For example, your very first prompt to Lovable might be: \_‚ÄúBefore writing any code, please **review the Knowledge Base** and confirm you understand the project.‚Äù\_‚Äã This lets the AI summarize or acknowledge the context, and you can catch if it missed something.

**Example Prompt ‚Äì Using the Knowledge Base:**

Copy

```
User: Before you write any code, please review the Knowledge Base and share your understanding of my project.
AI (likely response): ‚ÄúSure. Based on the Knowledge Base: You‚Äôre building a task management app for teams. The app flow is Users sign up -> see a dashboard -> create projects and tasks. The tech stack is Next.js for frontend, Supabase for backend (authentication and database). Core features include project creation, task assignments, and a reporting dashboard. In-scope features: task CRUD, user roles, email notifications; Out-of-scope: real-time collaboration. The design should follow a clean corporate style with Tailwind CSS, and it needs to be responsive. Backend uses Supabase with row-level security for multi-tenant data separation...‚Äù (and so on).
```

This kind of summary from the AI confirms it has ingested your specifications correctly. If it misunderstood anything, you can correct it in Chat mode. Once confirmed, you proceed with building (the AI now ‚Äúknows‚Äù the overall plan).

Writing a PRD and filling the Knowledge Base might feel like extra upfront work, but it **pays dividends throughout development**. It reduces errors and AI hallucinations because the AI always has a reference for what the app should do‚Äã‚Äã. It‚Äôs especially helpful for larger projects that can‚Äôt be built in one or two prompts. Think of it as seeding the AI with the same understanding you have in your head.

Lastly, maintain the Knowledge Base as your project evolves. If you add a major feature or change the scope, update the PRD/Knowledge Base document. This way, future prompts will consider the new information. It‚Äôs much easier than re-explaining context every time. In essence, the Knowledge Base + PRD is your AI project handbook ‚Äì it keeps everyone (you and the AI) on the same page about what you‚Äôre building and how.

Prompt Engineering

Prompting 1.1

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/prompting-one\#heads-up)  Heads up!

To help you make the most out of Lovable, we compiled a list of prompting strategies and approaches. Some of these were collected from our team‚Äôs experience, and others were shared with us by our community members. Since Lovable relies on large language models (LLMs), effective prompting strategies can significantly improve its efficiency and accuracy.

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/prompting-one\#what-is-prompting%3F)  What is Prompting?

Prompting refers to the textual instructions you give an AI system to perform a task‚Äã. In Lovable (an AI-powered app builder), prompts are how you ‚Äútell‚Äù the AI what to do ‚Äì from creating a UI to writing backend logic. Effective prompting is critical because Lovable uses large language models (LLMs), so clear, well-crafted prompts can greatly improve the AI‚Äôs efficiency and accuracy in building your app‚Äã. In short, better prompts lead to better results.

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/prompting-one\#why-prompting-matters)  Why Prompting Matters

Most people think prompting is just typing a request into an AI and hoping for the best ‚Äì **not so**. The difference between a mediocre AI response and having AI build entire workflows for you comes down to _how you prompt_. Whether you‚Äôre a developer or non-technical, mastering prompt engineering in **Lovable** can help you:

- **Automate repetitive tasks** by instructing the AI precisely what to do.
- **Debug faster** with AI-generated insights and solutions.
- **Build and optimize workflows effortlessly**, letting AI handle the heavy lifting once properly guided.

And the best part? You don‚Äôt need to be an expert programmer. With the right prompting techniques, you can unlock AI‚Äôs full potential in Lovable without wasted trial-and-error. This playbook will take you from foundational concepts to advanced prompt strategies so you can communicate with AI effectively and build faster.

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/prompting-one\#understanding-how-ai-thinks)  Understanding How AI Thinks

Unlike traditional coding, working with AI is about _communicating_ your intentions clearly. Large Language Models (LLMs) like the ones powering Lovable don‚Äôt ‚Äúunderstand‚Äù in a human sense ‚Äì they predict outputs based on patterns in their training data. This has important implications for how you should prompt:

For consistent outcomes, it helps to structure your prompt into clear sections. A recommended format (like _‚Äútraining wheels‚Äù_ for prompting) uses labeled sections for **Context**, **Task**, **Guidelines**, and **Constraints** ‚Äã:

- **Provide Context and Details:** AI models have no common sense or implicit context beyond what you give them. Always supply relevant background or requirements. For example, instead of just saying ‚ÄúBuild a login page,‚Äù specify details: _‚ÄúCreate a login page using React, with email/password authentication and JWT handling.‚Äù_ Include any tech stack or tools (e.g. ‚Äúusing Supabase for auth‚Äù) explicitly.
- **Be Explicit with Instructions and Constraints:** Never assume the AI will infer your goals. If you have constraints or preferences, state them. For instance, if an output should use a specific library or remain within certain scope, **tell the model up front**. The AI will follow your instructions **literally** ‚Äì ambiguities can lead to unwanted results or AI ‚Äúhallucinations‚Äù (made-up information).
- **Structure Matters (Order and Emphasis):** Thanks to transformer architecture, models pay special attention to the _beginning and end_ of your prompt. Leverage this by putting the most crucial details or requests at the start, and reiterating any absolute requirements at the end if needed. Also remember models have a fixed **context window** ‚Äì overly long prompts or very long conversations may cause the AI to forget earlier details. Keep prompts focused and refresh context when necessary (e.g. remind the model of key points if a session is long).
- **Know the Model‚Äôs Limits:** The AI‚Äôs knowledge comes from training data (e.g. Sonnet 3.7‚Äôs data cutoff, or Lovable‚Äôs provided knowledge base). It can‚Äôt know about recent events or proprietary info you haven‚Äôt given it. It will try to _sound_ confident even if it‚Äôs guessing (which leads to hallucinations). Always provide reference text or data for factual queries, or be prepared to verify its output. Also, complex instructions might be handled better by more advanced models (Lovable‚Äôs **Chat mode** likely uses a powerful model ideal for reasoning), whereas simple tasks can be done with default modes quickly. Understanding that LLMs generate text _one token at a time, predicting likely continuations_ can help you craft prompts that set them on the right path from the start.

Think of prompting as telling a very literal-minded intern _exactly_ what you need. The clearer and more structured your guidance, the better the results. Next, we‚Äôll dive into core principles that make a prompt effective.

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/prompting-one\#core-prompting-principles%3A-the-c-l-e-a-r-framework)  Core Prompting Principles: The C.L.E.A.R. Framework

Great prompts follow a set of simple principles. A handy way to remember them is **CLEAR**: **Concise, Logical, Explicit, Adaptive, Reflective**. Use these as a checklist when crafting your instructions:

- **Concise:** Be clear and get to the point. Extra fluff or vague language can confuse the model. Use direct language: for example, **BAD:** ‚ÄúCould you maybe write something about a science topic?‚Äù **GOOD:** ‚Äú **Write a 200-word summary of the effects of climate change on coastal cities**.‚Äù Avoid filler words ‚Äì if a detail isn‚Äôt instructive, it‚Äôs distracting. Aim for precision and brevity in describing what you want.
- **Logical:** Organize your prompt in a step-by-step or well-structured manner. Break complex requests into ordered steps or bullet points so the AI can follow easily. Rather than a single run-on request, separate concerns. **BAD:** ‚ÄúBuild me a user signup feature and also show some stats on usage.‚Äù **GOOD:** _‚ÄúFirst, implement a user sign-up form with email and password using Supabase. Then, after successful signup, display a dashboard showing user count statistics.‚Äù_ A logical flow ensures the model addresses each part of your request systematically.
- **Explicit:** State exactly what you want and don‚Äôt want. If something is important, spell it out. Provide examples of format or content if possible. The model has a vast knowledge, but it won‚Äôt read your mind about specifics. **BAD:** ‚ÄúTell me about dogs.‚Äù (Too open-ended.) **GOOD:** ‚Äú **List 5 unique facts about Golden Retrievers, in bullet points.**‚Äù Likewise, if you have a desired output style, say so (e.g. ‚ÄúRespond in JSON format‚Äù or ‚ÄúUse a casual tone‚Äù). Treat the AI like a beginner: assume nothing is obvious to it.
- **Adaptive:** Don‚Äôt settle for the first answer if it‚Äôs not perfect ‚Äì prompts can be refined **iteratively**. A big advantage of Lovable‚Äôs AI (and LLMs in general) is that you can have a dialogue. If the initial output misses the mark, _adapt your approach_: clarify instructions or point out errors in a follow-up prompt. For example, _‚ÄúThe solution you gave is missing the authentication step. Please include user auth in the code.‚Äù_ By iterating, you guide the model to better results. You can even ask the AI how to improve the prompt itself (this is **Meta Prompting**, covered later).
- **Reflective:** Take time to review what worked and what didn‚Äôt after each AI interaction. This is more about _you_ than the model ‚Äì as a prompt engineer, note which prompt phrasing got a good result and which led to confusion. After a complex session, you might even ask the AI to **summarize the final solution or reasoning** (we‚Äôll discuss Reverse Meta Prompting shortly). Being reflective helps you craft better prompts in the future, building a cycle of continuous improvement in your AI communication.

Keep these CLEAR principles in mind as you develop prompts. Next, we‚Äôll look at specific prompting techniques from basic to advanced, including how to structure prompts and leverage the AI as a collaborator.

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/prompting-one\#the-four-levels-of-prompting)  The Four Levels of Prompting

Effective prompting is a skill that grows with practice. Here we outline four levels of prompting mastery, from structured ‚Äútraining wheels‚Äù to advanced meta techniques. Each level has its use-case ‚Äì combine them as needed:

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/prompting-one\#1-structured-%E2%80%9Ctraining-wheels%E2%80%9D-prompting-explicit-format)  **1\. Structured ‚ÄúTraining Wheels‚Äù Prompting** (Explicit Format)

When you‚Äôre just starting or tackling a very complex task, it helps to use a labeled structure in your prompt. This acts as _training wheels_ to ensure you provide all necessary information. A proven format in Lovable is to break the prompt into sections like:

- **Context:** Background or role setup for the AI. (E.g. ‚ÄúYou are a world-class Lovable AI coding assistant.‚Äù)
- **Task:** The specific goal you want to achieve. (E.g. ‚ÄúBuild a full-stack to-do list app with user login and real-time sync.‚Äù)
- **Guidelines:** Preferred approach or style. (E.g. ‚ÄúUse React for frontend, Tailwind for styling, and Supabase for auth and database.‚Äù)
- **Constraints:** Hard limits or must-not-dos. (E.g. ‚ÄúDo not use any paid APIs. The app should work on mobile and desktop.‚Äù)

By clearly labeling each part, you leave little room for misunderstanding. For example, a prompt might look like:

**Context:** You are an expert full-stack developer using Lovable.

**Task:** Create a secure login page in React using Supabase (email/password auth).

**Guidelines:** The UI should be minimalistic, and follow Tailwind CSS conventions. Provide clear code comments for each step.

**Constraints:** Only modify the `LoginPage` component; do not change other pages. Ensure the final output is a working page in the Lovable editor.

This level of detail guides the AI step-by-step. _Training Wheels prompting_ is excellent for novices or complex multi-part tasks ‚Äì it forces you to think through exactly what you need, and it helps the model by structuring the request.

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/prompting-one\#2-conversational-prompting-no-training-wheels)  2\. Conversational Prompting (No Training Wheels)

As you get comfortable, you won‚Äôt always need such rigid structure. **Conversational prompting** means you can write to the AI more naturally, similar to how you‚Äôd explain a task to a colleague, while still being clear. The key is to maintain clarity and completeness **without** the formal labels. For instance:

Let‚Äôs build a feature to upload a profile picture. It should include a form with an image file input and a submit button. When submitted, it should store the image in Supabase storage and update the user profile. Please write the necessary React component and any backend function needed for this, and ensure to handle errors (like file too large) gracefully.

This is a more free-form prompt but still **logically ordered and explicit** about the requirements. No training wheels, yet it‚Äôs effective. Conversational prompts work well once you trust yourself not to forget important details. They keep interactions more natural, especially in ongoing chat where you‚Äôre iterating on results.

Even in conversational style, you can simulate structure by breaking into paragraphs or bullet points for different aspects of the request. The goal is the same: clear communication. You might use this style for quicker tasks or once the AI has already been primed with context.

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/prompting-one\#3-meta-prompting-ai-assisted-prompt-improvement)  3\. **Meta Prompting (AI-Assisted Prompt Improvement)**

This is an advanced technique where you literally ask the AI to help you improve your prompt or plan. Since Lovable‚Äôs AI (like ChatGPT) can reason about language, you can use it to refine your instructions. This is especially useful if you get an output that‚Äôs off-base ‚Äì it could be a sign your prompt was unclear. For example:

Review my last prompt and identify any ambiguity or missing info. How can I rewrite it to be more concise and precise?

Rewrite this prompt to be more specific and detailed: ‚ÄòCreate a secure login page in React using Supabase, ensuring role-based authentication.

The AI might respond with a better-structured or more detailed version of your request. This can reveal what was unclear. Essentially, you‚Äôre letting the AI act as a _prompt editor_. In Lovable, you can do this in **Chat mode** safely (since Chat mode won‚Äôt directly edit your project). Meta prompting turns the AI into a collaborator that helps you ask for what you really want. It‚Äôs a powerful way to bootstrap your prompt engineering skills ‚Äì the AI can suggest improvements you hadn‚Äôt considered.

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/prompting-one\#4-reverse-meta-prompting-ai-as-a-documentation-tool)  4\. **Reverse Meta Prompting (AI as a Documentation Tool)**

Reverse meta prompting means using the AI to summarize or document what happened _after_ a task, so you can learn or reuse it later. Think of it as asking the AI to reflect on the process and give you a prompt or explanation for next time. This is great for debugging and knowledge capture. For example, after you troubleshoot a tricky issue with Lovable, you might prompt:

Summarize the errors we encountered setting up JWT authentication and explain how we resolved them. Then, draft a prompt I could use in the future to avoid those mistakes when setting up auth.

The AI might produce a concise recap of the problem and solution, followed by a template prompt like _‚ÄúContext: building auth‚Ä¶ Task: avoid X error by doing Y‚Ä¶‚Äù_. This reverse meta approach helps you build a personal library of **reusable prompts** and lessons learned. In Lovable, this can be gold: the next time you face a similar task, you have a tried-and-true prompt ready to go (or at least a clear checklist to follow).

Suppose you spent an hour debugging why an API call failed. Once it‚Äôs fixed, ask the AI to document that. You‚Äôll not only reinforce your understanding, but also create material to feed into the Knowledge Base or future projects so the AI doesn‚Äôt repeat the same mistakes.

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/prompting-one\#advanced-prompting-techniques)  Advanced Prompting Techniques

Once you‚Äôve got the basics, it‚Äôs time to leverage more advanced strategies to get the most out of Lovable‚Äôs AI. These techniques help handle complex scenarios, reduce errors (like hallucinations), and tailor the AI‚Äôs output to your needs.

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/prompting-one\#zero-shot-vs-few-shot-prompting)  Zero-Shot vs. Few-Shot Prompting

**Zero-Shot Prompting** means you ask the model to perform a task with _no examples_. You rely on the model‚Äôs general training to know what to do. This is the default for most prompts: you state the request, and the AI generates an answer purely from what it ‚Äúknows‚Äù and understands from your prompt. Zero-shot is efficient and works well if the task is common or clearly described. For instance: _‚ÄúTranslate the following sentence to Spanish: ‚ÄòI am learning to code.‚Äô‚Äù_ is a zero-shot prompt ‚Äì straightforward command, and the AI uses its knowledge to respond (no examples needed).

**Few-Shot Prompting** means you provide a couple of **examples or demonstrations** in your prompt to show the AI exactly the format or style you want. Essentially, you‚Äôre teaching by example in the prompt itself. This can dramatically improve output quality for specific formats or when the task is unusual. In a few-shot prompt, you might say:

Correct the grammar in these sentences:\\n **Input:** ‚Äúthe code not working good‚Äù ‚Üí **Output:** ‚ÄúThe code is not working well.‚Äù\\n **Input:** ‚ÄúAPI give error in login‚Äù ‚Üí **Output:** ‚ÄúThe API gives an error during login.‚Äù\\nNow **Input:** ‚Äúuser not found in database‚Äù ‚Üí **Output:**

By giving two examples of input-output, the AI is primed to continue with a similar pattern for the third. Few-shot prompting is useful in Lovable when you need a specific style of response (e.g., code comments in a certain format, or commit message examples). It does consume more prompt tokens (because you‚Äôre including those examples), but often yields more consistent results.

**When to use which:**

Try zero-shot first for simple tasks or when you trust the model‚Äôs built-in ability. If the results aren‚Äôt in the format or depth you want, switch to few-shot by adding an example. For instance, if you ask for a function and the output isn‚Äôt following your preferred style, show an example function with the style you like and prompt again. Few-shots shine for complex output (like writing tests cases ‚Äì provide one sample test, then ask it to write more). In summary, **zero-shot for quick direct answers, few-shot for controlled style or complex instructions.**

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/prompting-one\#managing-hallucinations-and-ensuring-accuracy)  Managing Hallucinations and Ensuring Accuracy

AI ‚Äúhallucinations‚Äù are moments when the model confidently invents information or code that isn‚Äôt correct. In a coding platform like Lovable, hallucinations might mean the AI uses a nonexistent function, calls an API that doesn‚Äôt exist, or fabricates details in a summary. While we can‚Äôt eliminate this completely (it‚Äôs an AI limitation), we **can prompt in ways that reduce hallucinations**:

- **Provide Grounding Data:** The more _reliable context_ you give, the less the AI has to guess. In Lovable, always leverage the **Knowledge Base** for your project. Include your Project Requirements Document (PRD), user flows, tech stack, etc., in the project‚Äôs context. That way, the AI‚Äôs answers will be ‚Äúgrounded‚Äù in the specifics of _your_ app. For example, if your app uses a certain library or has a defined data model, put that in the Knowledge Base so the AI won‚Äôt make up different ones.
- **In-Prompt References:** When asking factual questions or code that interacts with external systems, include relevant documentation snippets or data. E.g., _‚ÄúUsing the API response format given below, parse the user object‚Ä¶ \[then include a small JSON example\].‚Äù_ By showing the AI real data or docs, it‚Äôs less likely to fabricate functions or fields.
- **Ask for Step-by-Step Reasoning:** Sometimes you suspect the AI might be winging it. In those cases, prompt it to show its reasoning or verification. For instance, in **Chat mode** you could say: _‚ÄúExplain your solution approach before giving the final code. If there are any uncertainties, state them.‚Äù_ This chain-of-thought prompting makes the AI slow down and check itself. It can catch errors or at least reveal them in the reasoning, which you can correct.
- **Instruct Honesty:** You can include a guideline in your prompt like _‚ÄúIf you are not sure of a fact or the correct code, do not fabricate it ‚Äì instead, explain what would be needed or ask for clarification.‚Äù_ Advanced models often follow such instructions (they might respond with, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not certain, but I assume X‚Ä¶‚Äù rather than just giving a wrong answer). It‚Äôs not foolproof, but it can mitigate confidently incorrect outputs.
- **Iterative Verification:** After the AI gives an answer, especially for critical things (like calculations, or important facts, or complex code), do a verification step. You can ask the AI, or use another tool, to double-check the output. For example: _‚ÄúConfirm that the above code follows the requirements and explain any part that might not meet the spec.‚Äù_ This prompt makes the AI review its work and often it will catch if it deviated from your instructions.

In Lovable, hallucinations might also mean the AI creates a file or component you didn‚Äôt ask for, or takes some creative liberty that wasn‚Äôt intended. Always review AI-generated code for sanity. If something looks too ‚Äúmagical‚Äù or unexpected, question it. By managing hallucinations with these strategies, you maintain control over your project and ensure accuracy.

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/prompting-one\#leveraging-model-insights-know-your-ai-tools)  Leveraging Model Insights (Know Your AI Tools)

Not all AI models are the same, and even the same model can behave differently depending on settings. To get master-level results, it helps to understand the tools at your disposal in Lovable:

- **Chat Mode vs Default Mode:** Lovable provides (as of this writing) a **Chat mode** (conversational AI assistant) and a Default/Editor mode (which directly applies changes). Use them intentionally. **Chat Mode** is excellent for brainstorming, discussing design decisions, or debugging ‚Äì the AI can freely generate ideas or analysis without immediately coding. For example, you might describe an error and in Chat mode say, _‚ÄúLet‚Äôs analyze this error log and figure out what went wrong.‚Äù_ The AI can then walk through potential causes. **Default Mode**, on the other hand, is for executing changes (writing code, creating components). A typical workflow might be: outline or troubleshoot in Chat mode, and once you have a plan, switch to Default mode to implement it with a straightforward prompt (since default mode will modify your project files). Knowing when to use each mode keeps your development flow efficient and safe.
- **Model Capabilities and Limits:** If you have options of models (e.g., GPT-4 vs GPT-3.5), use the one appropriate for the task. GPT-4 (often behind Chat mode) can handle more complex instructions and long reasoning chains, but it‚Äôs slower and may have higher cost. GPT-3.5 is faster/cheaper but sometimes needs more explicit guidance and may be more prone to errors in complex tasks. If Lovable Labs features allow it, enabling chain-of-thought or higher reasoning can be useful for debugging (e.g., you might literally instruct: ‚ÄúUse chain-of-thought reasoning to identify the root cause of this issue before fixing it.‚Äù). The AI will then output a reasoning process which you can follow.
- **Token Length and Responses:** Be aware of the response length. If you ask for a very large output (like a whole module of code), the AI might cut off or lose coherence if it exceeds the token limit. In such cases, break the task into smaller prompts (e.g., generate code for one function at a time). Lovable‚Äôs chat or prompt UI might show a warning if output is truncated ‚Äì that‚Äôs a sign to request the remaining part or divide the work.
- **Formatting and Code Preferences:** The AI can adapt to your formatting preferences if you state them. For example, tell it ‚Äúoutput code in markdown format‚Äù or ‚Äúfollow the project‚Äôs ESLint rules‚Äù if you have them. It won‚Äôt magically know your style guide unless you include it in the context. If you prefer certain naming conventions or patterns, you can mention that in the prompt (this is part of being Explicit). Over time, as the AI sees consistent style in your project, it will mimic it ‚Äì but giving gentle reminders in prompts can accelerate that alignment.

In summary, treat the AI as a powerful but literal tool. Understand the modes and models you‚Äôre interacting with, and always frame your prompts to play to their strengths (structured, detailed input) while guarding against their weaknesses (forgetfulness, verbosity, hallucinations). Now, let‚Äôs translate these principles into concrete best practices for using Lovable effectively.

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/prompting-one\#additional-prompting-tips)  **Additional Prompting tips**

Finally, let‚Äôs cover specific tips and techniques when working in the Lovable platform. These best practices combine the general prompt engineering concepts with Lovable‚Äôs features to help you get the best outcome.

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/prompting-one\#start-with-a-solid-knowledge-base)  Start with a Solid Knowledge Base

Before you even write a prompt, set up your project‚Äôs Knowledge Base (in Lovable‚Äôs project settings). Include the **Project Requirements (PRD)**, user flows, tech stack details, UI design guidelines, and any backend specifics. This acts as persistent context the AI will always have. For example, if your PRD clearly lists ‚ÄúOut of scope: social login‚Äù, the AI is less likely to randomly add a Google login feature. You can also explicitly prompt at the start:

_Before writing any code, read the project Knowledge Base and confirm you understand the app‚Äôs purpose and constraints._

This ensures the AI internalizes your project‚Äôs context and reduces irrelevant suggestions or hallucinated features.

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/prompting-one\#be-specific%2C-avoid-vagueness)  Be specific, avoid vagueness

Vague prompts lead to vague results. Always clarify _what_ you want and _how_.

**DON‚ÄôT**:

Copy

```
Make this app better.
```

**Another example:**

Copy

```
Create a form for user input
```

**DO**:

The latter gives clear direction on scope and expected outcome.

Copy

```
Refactor the app to clean up unused components and improve performance, without changing UI or functionality.
```

**Another example:**

Copy

```
Create a user registration form with fields for username, email, and password and include a submit button.
```

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/prompting-one\#incremental-prompting)  Incremental prompting

Resist the urge to ask for an entire complex app in one prompt. Break your development process into logical steps and prompt for one at a time.

**DON‚ÄôT**:

Copy

```
Build a CRM app with Supabase, auth, Google Sheets export, and data enrichment.

Build my entire e-commerce app with authentication, product listings, and checkout.
```

**DO**:

This step-by-step progression‚Äã‚Äã helps the AI stay focused and accurate, and you can catch issues early:

Copy

```
Set up a Supabase-connected CRM backend.
```

Copy

```
Great! Could you please add a secure authentication flow with user roles?
```

Copy

```
Thank you! The next step is to integrate Google Sheets to export records.
```

**Another example:**

Copy

```
Set up a database schema for user information.
```

Copy

```
Develop an API endpoint to retrieve user data please
```

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/prompting-one\#include-constraints-and-requirements)  Include Constraints and Requirements

Don‚Äôt shy away from spelling out constraints. If something _must_ or _must not_ be done, say so.

**Adding constraints**

Copy

```
Create a simple to-do app with a maximum of 3 tasks visible at a time.
Include the ability to add, edit, and delete tasks.
```

Copy

```
Optimize this code, but ensure the UI and core functionality remain unchanged. Document each change you make.
```

Copy

```
Use at most 3 API calls for this, and ensure no external library is required.
```

Copy

```
The page should display a maximum of 3 tasks at a time.
```

Such limits keep the AI from over-engineering. Adding a constraint like a max number of items or a performance target can focus the AI on what‚Äôs important‚Äã.

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/prompting-one\#avoid-ambiguity-in-wording)  Avoid ambiguity in wording

If a term could be interpreted in different ways, clarify it. The clearer you are, the less the AI has to guess.

**DON‚ÄôT**:

Copy

```
Add a profile feature
```

Copy

```
Support notifications
```

**DO**:

The latter gives clear direction on scope and expected outcome.

Copy

```
Add a user profile page with fields X, Y, Z.
```

Copy

```
Send an email notification on form submission.
```

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/prompting-one\#mind-your-tone-and-courtesy)  Mind your tone and courtesy

While it doesn‚Äôt change functionality, a polite tone can sometimes yield better results‚Äã. Phrases like ‚Äúplease‚Äù or a respectful ask can add context and make the prompt a bit more descriptive, which can help the AI. For example,

_Please refrain from modifying the homepage, focus only on the dashboard component._

This reads as polite, and it explicitly tells the AI what not to do. It‚Äôs not about the AI‚Äôs feelings ‚Äì it‚Äôs about packing in detail. (Plus, it never hurts to be nice‚Äã!)

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/prompting-one\#use-lovable%E2%80%99s-modes-intentionally)  Use Lovable‚Äôs Modes Intentionally

As mentioned, utilize **Chat Mode** for planning and **Default Mode** for building. For example, when starting a new feature, you might enter Chat Mode and brainstorm the component breakdown:

I want to add a blog section to my app. Let‚Äôs discuss how to structure the data and pages.

The AI might respond with an outline. Once you‚Äôre satisfied, you can switch to Default Mode and say:

Create a `BlogPost` page and a supabase table or schema for blog posts based on the above plan.

Chat Mode is also great for debugging without consuming your prompt credits on failed edits

e.g., in Chat ask ‚ÄúWhy might the login function be returning undefined?‚Äù to get analysis, then apply the fix in code with an edit prompt.

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/prompting-one\#use-formatting-to-your-advantage)  Use formatting to your advantage

Structure lists or steps when appropriate. If you want the AI to output a list or follow a sequence, enumerate them in the prompt. By numbering steps, you hint the AI to respond in kind.

Copy

```
Let's think through the process of setting up a secure authentication system:
1. What are the necessary components?
2. How should they interact?
3. Provide the implementation code.
```

_First, explain the approach. Second, show the code. Third, give a test example._

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/prompting-one\#leverage-examples-or-references)  Leverage examples or references

If you have a target design or code style, mention it or provide an example. Providing an example (image or code snippet) gives the AI a concrete reference to emulate.

**Setting the context**

Copy

```
We are building a project management tool that helps teams track their tasks.
This tool should have features like:
 - user authentication
 - project creation
 - task assignments
 - reporting

Now, for the first task, create the UI for project creation.
```

**Another example:**

Copy

```
I need a CRM app with Supabase integration and a secure auth flow. Start by setting up the backend.
```

**Another example:**

Copy

```
We are developing an e-commerce platform focusing on eco-friendly products. Generate a product listing page with filters for category and price.
```

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/prompting-one\#using-image-prompts)  Using image prompts

Lovable even allows image uploads with your prompt, so you can show a design and say ‚Äúmatch this style‚Äù.

There are two main approaches here. The first one is a simple prompting approach.

**Simple image upload prompting**

You can upload an image and then add an example prompt like this:

Copy

```
Create and implement a UI that looks as similar as possible to the image attached.
```

Copy

```
This screenshot shows a layout issue on mobile. Adjust margins and padding to make it responsive while keeping the same design structure.
```

Or, you can help AI better understand the content of the image and some additional specifics about it. Excellent results can be achieved by adding specific instructions to the image uploaded. While the image is worth a thousand words, adding a couple of your own to describe desired functionality can go a long way - especially since interactions cannot always be obvious from a static image.

**Image prompting with detailed instructions**

Copy

```
I want you to create the app as similar as possible to the one shown in this screenshot.
It's essentially a kanban clone.
It should have the ability to add new cards (tickets) in each column, have the ability to change the order of those tickets within a single column, and even move those cards between columns.
Feel free to use the Pangea home dnd npm package for drag-and-drop functionality.
```

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/prompting-one\#feedback-integration)  Feedback integration

Review the AI‚Äôs output and provide specific feedback for refinements.

Copy

```
The login form looks good, but please add validation for the email field to ensure it contains a valid email address.
```

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/prompting-one\#emphasizing-accessibility)  Emphasizing Accessibility

Encourage the generation of code that adheres to accessibility standards and modern best practices. This ensures that the output is not only functional but also user-friendly and compliant with accessibility guidelines.

Copy

```
Generate a React component for a login form that follows accessibility best practices, including appropriate ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support.
```

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/prompting-one\#predefined-components-and-libraries)  Predefined Components and Libraries

Specify the use of certain UI libraries or components to maintain consistency and efficiency in your project. This directs the AI to utilize specific tools, ensuring compatibility and a uniform design language across your application.

Copy

```
Create a responsive navigation bar using the shadcn/ui library with Tailwind CSS for styling.
```

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/prompting-one\#)

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/prompting-one\#multilingual-prompting)  Multilingual Prompting

When working in a multilingual environment, specify the desired language for both code comments and documentation. This ensures that the generated content is accessible to team members who speak different languages, enhancing collaboration.

Copy

```
Generate a Python script that calculates the Fibonacci sequence. Provide comments and documentation in French.
```

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/prompting-one\#defining-project-structure-and-file-management)  Defining Project Structure and File Management

Clearly outline the project structure, including file names and paths, to ensure organized and maintainable code generation. This provides clarity on where new components should reside within the project, maintaining a coherent file organization.

Copy

```
Create a new React component named 'UserProfile' and save it as 'components/user-profile.tsx'. Ensure it includes a profile picture, username, and bio section.
```

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/prompting-one\#provide-precise-edit-instructions-focus-the-ai)  Provide Precise Edit Instructions (Focus the AI)

By default, when you ask Lovable AI to change something, it might rewrite an entire file or multiple files. To avoid unintended changes, be very specific about _where_ and _what_ to change. You can use Lovable‚Äôs ‚ÄúSelect‚Äù feature to highlight a component or file, then prompt about that selection only. Or explicitly name the file/component in your prompt. For example:

\_In the \_ `Header` _component, change the signup button‚Äôs text to ‚ÄòGet Started‚Äô and move it to the left side of the nav bar._

This way, the AI knows to focus on `Header` component and just adjust that part. Another trick: **tell the AI what not to touch**. You might add, ‚ÄúDo not modify any other components or logic unrelated to the header.‚Äù This prevents the AI from wandering off and potentially breaking something else. This practice (sometimes called the ‚ÄúDiff & Select‚Äù approach) ensures minimal, targeted changes ‚Äì resulting in faster responses and fewer regression bugs.

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/prompting-one\#locking-files-workaround)  Locking Files (Workaround)

Currently, Lovable might not have an explicit file-lock feature, but you can simulate it through your prompt wording. If there are critical files that the AI should never alter (maybe a complex component that is working fine), you can repeat an instruction in every prompt like:

_Do not change the authentication.js file._

By consistently telling the AI to refrain, you reduce the chance of unwanted edits. Similarly, if you only want the AI to work within one part of the project, explicitly constrain it:

\_Focus changes solely on the \_ `ProfilePage` _component; assume all other parts of the app remain as is._

Being upfront about this in the prompt helps keep the AI within bounds.

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/prompting-one\#design-and-ui-tweaks)  Design and UI Tweaks

When prompting for UI changes in Lovable, clarity is crucial so you don‚Äôt break functionality:

- If you want **purely visual changes**, say so. _**‚ÄúMake the login button blue and 20% larger, but do not alter any of its functionality or onClick logic.‚Äù**_ This ensures the AI doesn‚Äôt accidentally rename IDs or change logic while restyling.
- For **responsiveness** (making a design mobile-friendly), guide the AI through a plan. For example: _‚ÄúOptimize the landing page for mobile: use a mobile-first approach. Start by outlining how each section should rearrange on smaller screens, then implement those CSS changes. Use standard Tailwind breakpoints (sm, md, lg) and avoid custom breakpoints. Ensure nothing in functionality changes, just layout.‚Äù_ By providing this kind of detailed instruction, you get a thorough adaptation to mobile without breaking the desktop layout.
- If you have a design change in mind, describing the desired outcome and any constraints (like ‚Äúkeep the same HTML structure, just update CSS‚Äù) will help the AI focus on the right solution. Always test the app after AI design changes to confirm everything still works as expected.

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/prompting-one\#refactoring-and-optimizing-code)  Refactoring and Optimizing Code

As your project evolves, Lovable‚Äôs AI might suggest refactoring to improve performance or maintainability. Prompting for refactoring is an advanced but valuable use-case:

- Emphasize **no change in behavior**: \_‚ÄúRefactor the _**code for clarity and efficiency, but \_ the app‚Äôs functionality and outputs must remain identical.‚Äù**_ This tells the AI the refactor should not introduce bugs or feature changes.
- You can ask for a **refactor plan first**: \_‚ÄúScan the \_ `utils/` _folder and suggest improvements in code structure or duplication. List changes but do not apply them yet.‚Äù_ The AI might give you a report of what to improve. Then you can decide which changes to prompt for implementation.
- For large-scale refactoring, do it in stages. Prompt one module at a time, test, then move on. This pairs with the step-by-step principle. For example: first refactor the state management logic, later refactor API calls, rather than everything in one go.
- After refactoring, it‚Äôs wise to prompt a quick **post-check**: _‚ÄúNow that the code is refactored, run through a quick checklist: does the UI look the same and do all tests or key flows still pass?‚Äù_ The AI can self-verify or list things to manually check.

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/prompting-one\#debugging-with-ai-assistance)  Debugging with AI Assistance

Bugs are inevitable. Lovable has a ‚ÄúTry to Fix‚Äù feature for quick fixes, but you can also enlist the AI through prompts:

- When an error occurs, copy any **error logs or messages** into a prompt (in Chat mode ideally) and ask: _‚ÄúHere‚Äôs the error and relevant code snippet ‚Äì what is causing this and how can we fix it?‚Äù_ Detailed error context helps the AI pinpoint the issue.

- Use the CLEAR principles while debugging: be Explicit about what the code was supposed to do versus what happened. Sometimes just explaining the bug in detail to the AI will lead it to the solution.

- If the AI‚Äôs first fix doesn‚Äôt work, use the Adaptive principle: clarify what changed or provide the new error, and ask it to try again or suggest an alternative approach.

- Leverage Chat Mode to discuss the bug: _‚ÄúThe fix didn‚Äôt work. The state is still undefined at runtime. What else could be wrong? Let‚Äôs think through possible causes.‚Äù_ You can have a back-and-forth until a plausible solution is found, then apply it in Default Mode.









For UI bugs, you can even share a screenshot (if Lovable supports image input in chat) or describe the visual issue. E.g., ‚ÄúThe sidebar is supposed to hide on mobile, but it‚Äôs still visible. Here‚Äôs the CSS‚Ä¶ Why might it be failing?‚Äù The AI can reason about CSS or layout issues if given enough info.

- Always test after a fix. If it works, consider using Reverse Meta Prompting to have the AI summarize what the root cause was and how to avoid it in the future, enriching your knowledge base.


### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/prompting-one\#when-and-when-not-to-involve-the-ai)  When (and When Not) to Involve the AI

- A master prompter knows that sometimes, you don‚Äôt need to prompt at all. If a change is extremely small or you already know how to do it quickly (e.g., changing a text label, adjusting one padding value), it can be faster to just do it manually in the code editor. Over-relying on the AI for trivial tasks can slow you down and use up your prompt quota. Use the AI where it adds value ‚Äì complex logic, boilerplate generation, multi-step operations, or things you‚Äôre unsure about. For simpler issues, you might:
  - Use your own knowledge or a quick search (or even ask ChatGPT outside of Lovable) to figure it out, especially if it avoids burning a prompt on something the AI might misunderstand.
  - Utilize developer tools: open the browser DevTools console to inspect an element or debug a JavaScript error in real time. Once you identify the fix, you can either implement it directly or confirm via a prompt.

If you notice a button is the wrong color, it might be faster to just fix the CSS class yourself than to describe the issue to the AI and risk it changing more than intended. On the other hand, if you need to implement a new feature from scratch, that‚Äôs a perfect job for the AI ‚Äì you describe the what and why, and it figures out the how in code.

Remember, Lovable‚Äôs AI is like an assistant developer. You manage it by giving clear tasks and oversight. It can drastically speed up development, but you remain the lead who reviews and directs the work.

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/prompting-one\#applying-these-strategies-in-different-tools)  Applying These Strategies in Different Tools

The prompting principles above apply not just in Lovable‚Äôs chat, but anywhere you interact with AI or automation tools:

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/prompting-one\#in-lovable%E2%80%99s-builder)  In Lovable‚Äôs Builder

You‚Äôll primarily use these prompts in the Lovable chat interface to build and refine your app.

1. Start with a broad project prompt, then iterate feature by feature.
2. Use Chat-Only mode when you need to discuss or debug without changing code.

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/prompting-one\#with-make-com-or-n8n-workflow-automation)  W [**ith make.com or n8n (workflow automation)**](http://make.com/)

You might not prompt these platforms in natural language the same way, but designing an automation **still benefits from clear AI instructions**.

For instance, you can have Lovable generate integration logic:

[_**When a form is submitted, send the data to a Make.com webhook for Slack notification.**_](http://make.com/)

In fact, Lovable can help set up automation by integrating with webhooks. If your app needs to hand off tasks (like sending emails, updating a CRM), you can prompt Lovable to use Make or n8n.

[_**After a user signs up in the app, trigger a Make.com workflow that creates a record in Salesforce.**_](http://make.com/)

Lovable will write the code to call that webhook or API. Keeping the prompt structured ensures the AI knows exactly how to connect Lovable with those external services.

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/prompting-one\#edge-cases-and-external-integrations)  **Edge cases and external integrations**

Lovable integrates with many services (Stripe, GitHub, Supabase, etc.). When prompting for these, treat the integration details as part of your **Context/Constraints**. For example,

_Connect the form to Stripe (test mode) for payments. On success, redirect to /thank-you._

Be clear about what external services should do. The same goes for using n8n (self-hosted automation) ‚Äì you might write,

_Send a POST request to the n8n webhook URL after form submission, and wait for its response to show a confirmation message._

Clarity here is key so the AI produces the correct calls.

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/prompting-one\#summary)  Summary

- Strong prompting is about **clarity, structure, and context**. Whether you‚Äôre telling Lovable to build a feature, or orchestrating a [Make.com](http://make.com/) scenario, the goal is to paint a picture of what you want.
- Start with structured prompts if you‚Äôre unsure, and evolve to more conversational style as you gain confidence.
- Use meta techniques to improve and learn from each interaction.
- With practice, you‚Äôll guide the AI like an extension of your dev team ‚Äì and it will feel natural to get exactly the output you need.

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/prompting-one\#conclusion)  Conclusion

By now, you should have a solid grasp of how to craft prompts that are clear, effective, and tailored to Lovable‚Äôs AI. From the foundational CLEAR principles to advanced strategies like few-shot examples and meta prompting, these techniques empower you to get exactly what you need from the AI ‚Äì no more, no less. You‚Äôve learned to structure your requests, provide context, avoid pitfalls like hallucinations, and leverage Lovable-specific features (Knowledge Base, Chat mode, etc.) to streamline your workflow.

Master-level prompting is a game changer: it turns AI from a gimmick into a reliable teammate. With practice, you‚Äôll find that you can build apps faster, debug with less frustration, and even explore creative solutions by simply _asking the right questions_ and giving the right guidance. The key is to stay **smart, concise, direct, and adaptive** in your instructions ‚Äì much like a seasoned engineer communicating with their team.

Finally, always keep learning from each interaction (that Reflective habit). Every prompt/response is feedback for you to refine your technique further. As you continue to build in Lovable, you‚Äôll develop an intuition for what the AI needs to hear to produce great results. Combine that with your own ingenuity, and there‚Äôs little you can‚Äôt achieve.

**Focus on your big ideas** ‚Äì let Lovable‚Äôs AI handle the execution details once you clearly tell it what to do.

Happy prompting, and happy building!

Integrations

Stripe & Payments

![Integrate Stripe in Lovable](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lovable-f9060f1e/images/lovable-stripe.webp)

Lovable now lets you set up Stripe entirely through **chat**.

**Chat‚Äëdriven auto‚Äësetup (recommended)**

After you connect **Supabase** and save your **Stripe Secret Key** via **Add¬†API¬†Key**, just describe what you need:

- ‚ÄúAdd three subscription tiers ‚Ä¶‚Äù
- ‚ÄúCreate a one‚Äëtime checkout for my e‚Äëbook at¬†$29‚Äù


Lovable generates the checkout / portal edge functions, database tables with RLS, and UI buttons‚Äîno manual coding or webhooks unless you ask for them.

- For **one‚Äëoff sales**, be sure your cart or product page already works.
- For **subscriptions**, confirm Supabase¬†Auth is in place so Lovable can link Stripe customers to each user‚Äôs **id**

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/setting-up-payments\#key-takeaways)  Key Takeaways

- Use the **chat‚Äëdriven flow** for both subscriptions and one‚Äëoff payments.
- **Never paste your Stripe Secret Key in chat.** Configure it via the in-chat **Add¬†API¬†Key** form.
- **Webhooks are opt‚Äëin.** Lovable relies on edge‚Äëfunction polling unless you request webhooks.
- Debug in **Browser¬†Console¬†‚Üí Network/Errors**, **Supabase¬†‚Üí Edge¬†Functions¬†‚Üí Logs**, and **Stripe¬†Dashboard¬†‚Üí Logs**.
- Always test in **Stripe¬†Test¬†Mode**, then deploy.

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/setting-up-payments\#requirements)  Requirements

Before integrating Stripe, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

- The project **must** be connected to Supabase. [Learn more about Supabase](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/supabase)
- A **Stripe account** with properly configured products.
- A working **frontend and backend**:

  - For individual product sales, ensure a shopping cart and checkout page are functional.
  - For subscriptions, set up login functionalities and different pricing tiers.

**Please note**
Stripe integration doesn‚Äôt work in preview. To test the integration, make sure to deploy. You should also make sure to be in test mode in Stripe when trying out the functionality. When testing payment, card number: 4242 4242 4242 4242, any 3 digits as CVC and any future date will work as a card.

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/setting-up-payments\#stripe-payment-setup-no%E2%80%91code-chat-flow)  Stripe Payment Setup (No‚ÄëCode Chat Flow)

Lovable now generates all Stripe logic for you. Once your **Stripe Secret Key** is configured via the in-chat **Add API Key** form and your project is **connected to Supabase**, simply tell Lovable what you need in chat‚Äîno manual Payment Links required.

1

Step 1

**Prep your project**

- Supabase connected
- Stripe Secret Key added via the in-chat **Add API Key** form
- (Optional) Prices or product IDs handy

2

Step 2

Examples:

- Create a one-time checkout for my ‚ÄúDigital Course‚Äù at $29
- Set up an annual Premium plan for $99, tied to each user‚Äôs id

3

Step 3

**Review & apply**
Lovable auto‚Äëscaffolds the Edge Functions, database tables, and UI components (all tied to the user‚Äôs id in Supabase). Check the preview, then click **Apply** to deploy.

- Subscriptions should always linked to the authenticated user‚Äôs `id` in Supabase for secure, role‚Äëbased access.

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/setting-up-payments\#advanced-integration%3A-webhooks-%26-supabase)  Advanced Integration: Webhooks & Supabase

For complex payment structures such as **subscriptions and role-based access**, Lovable recommends using **Supabase** to securely handle Stripe integration. This allows for proper webhook handling, subscription management, and role-based access control based on payment tiers.

The Edge Function that handles the necessary changes to the user account should be set up automatically by the AI.

1

Connect Supabase to Your Project

Getting started is simple. Lovable makes connecting Supabase effortless with a built-in native integration:

1. Click the **Supabase button** in the top right corner of Lovable.
2. Follow the instructions to link your project.
3. Once connected, Supabase enables secure payment processing, subscription management, webhook handling, customer data storage, and error handling.

2

Secure Payment Processing

Initiate the process by prompting Lovable:

Let‚Äôs connect Stripe to my project. We will begin with secure payment processing.

Lovable will generate the necessary SQL schema for handling payments. This includes database tables for users, subscriptions, and payments. You can review and customize these tables to fit your specific product needs before applying changes.

3

Implement Edge Functions for Webhooks

**Edge Functions** in Supabase act as small, high-performance serverless functions that run close to the user, ensuring fast responses. They help process webhook events, such as payment confirmations, before updating the database.

1

Step 1

**Retrieve the Endpoint URL** from the Edge Function in Supabase.

2

Step 2

**Go to Stripe Dashboard** \> Developers > Webhooks > Create an Event Destination.
![Stripe API Key](https://lovable.dev/content/news/stripe-api.png)

3

Step 3

**Select Webhook Events** that align with your project needs:

- `payment_intent.succeeded`
- `payment_intent.payment_failed`
- `customer.subscription.created`
- `customer.subscription.updated`
- `customer.subscription.deleted`

4

Step 4

**Enter the Endpoint URL** from Supabase.

5

Step 5

**Copy the Webhook Secret** and store it securely in **Supabase ‚Üí Edge Functions ‚Üí Manage Secrets ‚Üí Add New Secret**.

If unsure about naming the secret, ask Lovable in **chat mode** for guidance.

4

Securely Add API Keys

To integrate Stripe securely, avoid sharing your API key directly in chat. Instead:

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lovable-f9060f1e/images/ConnectLovabletoStripe(1).png)

1

Step 1

**Go to Stripe Dashboard** \> Developers > API Keys.

2

Step 2

**Copy the Secret Key** (DO NOT paste it directly in Lovable chat).

3

Step 3

**Use the Lovable ‚ÄúAdd API Key‚Äù feature** to securely store it.

**Important Security Warning**

Never paste your **Secret Key** directly in Lovable chat. Treat it like the keys to your house‚Äîexposing it could allow unauthorized access to your Stripe account. Instead, store it securely using Lovable‚Äôs API key feature.

5

Testing Your Integration

- **Use Stripe‚Äôs Test Mode** to safely test payments.
- **Test card details**:

  - Card Number: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
  - Any future expiration date
  - Any 3-digit CVC
- **Deploy your app**‚ÄîStripe integration does not work in preview mode.

1

Use the Try to Fix Button First

Click the **Try to Fix** button when an error shows up. Lovable will scan your logs, detect the issue, and attempt a quick fix. It‚Äôs your fastest first move. If that doesn‚Äôt work, it‚Äôs time to dig deeper.

2

Diagnose Unexpected Behavior

Your code may run without errors but not behave as intended. That‚Äôs **unexpected behavior**‚Äîharder to spot and harder to fix. Try this:

- **Review your original prompt** to confirm your instructions.
- **Break it down**: Check individual components and logic.
- **Add visuals**: Use screenshots to clarify what went wrong.

3

Write More Effective Prompts

Clear, structured prompts lead to better results. Use this format:

1. **Project Overview** ‚Äì What are you building?
2. **Page Structure** ‚Äì List key pages/components.
3. **Navigation Logic** ‚Äì Describe user flow.
4. **Visual Aids** ‚Äì Upload wireframes or screenshots.
5. **Implementation Steps** ‚Äì Lay out the build order.

4

Build in Logical Order

Structure matters. Follow this recommended flow:

1. Create layout and pages.
2. Connect Supabase or your backend.
3. Set up authentication and user roles.
4. Plan and organize feature logic.
5. Prompt Lovable to implement features.

5

Use Chat Mode for Clarity

When unsure, switch to **Chat Mode**:

- Ask Lovable to **analyze your project state**.
- Request a **recap of attempted solutions**.
- Prompt for **new directions** to solve persistent problems.

6

If You're Still Stuck: Advanced Tactics

Still no luck? Try this:

- **Be exact** ‚Äì Describe the bug and your expectations clearly.
- **Use images** ‚Äì Screenshots or videos help illustrate problems.
- **Ask directly** ‚Äì ‚ÄúWhat else can we try?‚Äù
- **Rollback** ‚Äì Restore to a working version and rebuild incrementally.

Tips & tricks

Using images in Lovable

To add images you can do one of four things:

Upload the image to the prompt chat

Simply upload them in the chat and explain to Lovable‚Äôs AI where and how you‚Äôd like them to appear in your project.

Replace it on the visual editor

You can replace an existing image directly using the [visual editor](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/precision-edit#visual-edits) functionality:

1

Step 1

Click on ‚ÄúEdit‚Äù tool.

2

Step 2

Select the image holder you would like to change.

![images/visual-edit-replace.png](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lovable-f9060f1e/images/visual-edit-replace.png)

Step 3

Change the image.

![images/visual-edit-image.png](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lovable-f9060f1e/images/visual-edit-image.png)

Using an external image URL

One way to add images to your project is by referencing an image from an external URL. This method allows you to use images hosted on external platforms like Unsplash, Imgur, or any other image-hosting service. Be mindful of use copyrights!

Here‚Äôs how to prompt Lovable to use an external image:

1

Step 1

Find the image you want to use.

For example, you can visit a site like Unsplash, select an image, and copy its URL.

2

Step 2

In your project prompt, simply tell Lovable to use that image by specifying the URL. For example:

Copy

```
Use the image from this URL
https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Pale_Blue_Dot.png/442px-Pale_Blue_Dot.png
for the hero section image.
```

Using images from your GitHub public directory

Another method to add images to your Lovable project is by using images uploaded to the `public` directory of your connected GitHub repository. Here‚Äôs how you can do it:

1

Connect your GitHub repository

Ensure your project is connected to your GitHub repo. [Here‚Äôs how to connect your repo](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/git-integration).

2

Locate the public folder

Inside your GitHub repository, navigate to the `public` directory. This folder is typically used for hosting assets like images that can be referenced in your project.

3

Add file

Click on **Add file** and then from a dropdown, select **Upload files** option.
![Selecting files for upload](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lovable-f9060f1e/assets/using-images-github-upload.png)

4

Upload an image

The next step is to transfer your image to your repo:

- Drag and drop the image into the public folder, or
- Click on the **‚Äúchoose your files‚Äù** link to browse and select the image file.
![Selecting files for upload](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lovable-f9060f1e/assets/using-images-github-commiting.png)

5

Commit the changes

After selecting your image, write a simple commit message (e.g., ‚ÄúAdding image files to be used in the app‚Äù) and click **‚ÄúCommit changes‚Äù** to save the file to your repo.

6

Get the image path

Once the file is uploaded, select it and then click on the copy icon next to the file name to copy the image‚Äôs path. This path will be used in your Lovable prompt.
![Selecting files for upload](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lovable-f9060f1e/assets/using-images-github-selecting.png)

7

Use the image in Lovable

You can now reference this image in your project by using a prompt like the following:

Copy

```
Add an additional image to the hero section.
This time, use this one from my local repo: public/c-64-close-up.jpg.jpeg
```

Be sure to use your image name and path you copied in the previous step.

Uploading large images to your GitHub repo can cause it to grow in size, which can affect Lovable performance (longer repo cloning times, slower startup of previews/sandbox).

Try to optimize your images before uploading them to your `public` folder by compressing them and using dimensions that are relevant to your use case. For example, don‚Äôt use a full HD-sized image if it will only be displayed as a small icon.

To help you better understand how to integrate images using the methods outlined above, we have a project you can explore: [Lovable Project Example](https://lovable.dev/projects/e823fedf-238d-4313-86a8-1fd4bfc2a9ba). In this project, you can see the actual prompts and how each method works in practice.

Additionally, here‚Äôs a public GitHub repository that includes the commits, uploaded images, and full implementation details. You can view the repository here: [GitHub: Adding Images Example](https://github.com/viborc/adding-images-example).

Feel free to explore the project and repository to deepen your understanding and improve your implementation skills.

Tips & tricks

Using Videos

Lovable offers two methods for embedding videos into your projects. Below, we‚Äôll cover both options step by step:

Linking to an external video

The simplest and recommended way to incorporate a video is by linking to one hosted externally, like on YouTube.

Example prompt

Copy

```
Embed this video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
in the hero content section.
```

Using a video from your GitHub public folder

Uploading large videos to your GitHub repo can cause it to grow in size, which can affect Lovable performance (longer repo cloning times, slower startup of previews/sandbox).

A better option is to use hosted services (like YouTube) or file storage options like S3, essentially giving you a URL that you can reference, as described in the previous steps.

You can upload videos to your project‚Äôs GitHub repository and reference them directly. Here‚Äôs how:

1

Connect your GitHub repository

First, make sure your project is linked to a GitHub repo. [Here‚Äôs how to set up your repo](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/git-integration).

2

Access the public folder

Inside your connected repository, navigate to the `public` directory. This folder is specifically used for hosting project assets like images, videos, and other media.

3

Upload a video

You can now add your video to the public folder by either dragging and dropping it or clicking **‚Äúchoose your files‚Äù** to browse and upload the file from your local machine.

4

Commit the file

After selecting your video file, enter a brief commit message (e.g., ‚ÄúAdds a Mars video to be used in the app‚Äù) and click **‚ÄúCommit changes‚Äù**.
![Committing video file](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lovable-f9060f1e/assets/using-videos-github-commiting.png)

5

Get the video path

Once the upload is complete, click on the video file and use the copy icon :octicons-copy-16: to copy its path. You‚Äôll need this path in the next step.
![Copy video file path](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lovable-f9060f1e/assets/using-videos-github-selecting.png)

6

Reference the video in Lovable

Now, you can embed the video by specifying the file path in your prompt. For example, you can use a prompt like this one:

Example prompt

Copy

```
Insert an additional video into the introduction section using this file:
public/mars-video-nasa.mp4
```

Ensure you use the exact file path you copied earlier.

To see these methods in action, explore one of the example projects: [Lovable using videos example project](https://lovable.dev/projects/380835ab-c8d7-4f45-9b0d-51ec04294457). You‚Äôll find real prompts demonstrating how videos are integrated using both methods.

Additionally, for a more technical look at the video adding process, check out this public repository: [GitHub: Video Upload Example](https://github.com/viborc/adding-videos-example). It includes the video upload and the implementation details used in the project.

Landing Page

Learn how to go from idea to a fully functional, animated landing page, using AI + a sprinkle of razzle dazzle.

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/use-case/landing-page\#two-ways-to-build-landing-pages)  Two Ways to Build Landing Pages

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/use-case/landing-page\#1-one-shot-generation)  1\. One-Shot Generation

Let Lovable do the heavy lifting. Just write a single prompt and let the AI generate your entire landing page.

**Prompt Example:**

Copy

```
You are a CRO expert. Build a landing page for a space tourism agency targeting wealthy individuals. The experience includes zero-gravity flights. Follow conversion rate optimization best practices.
```

Add specific audience, features, or tone to help Lovable make better assumptions.

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/use-case/landing-page\#2-section-by-section)  2\. Section-by-Section

Prefer more control? Build one piece at a time: hero, pricing, FAQs, and more.

**Example flow:**

1

Step 1

Generate a blank hero section

2

Step 2

Click into any section with [visual edits](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/visual-edit) to:

- Change text, colors, size
- Move or delete elements
- Tweak layout or animations

3

Step 3

Add images, animations, pricing tables (details at the bottom)

4

Step 4

Refactor styling + add branding + request a theme like:

- Dark mode
- Neo-brutalism
- Glassmorphism
- Futuristic fonts (e.g., _Space Grotesque_)

‚ÄúMake the layout more elegant and smaller‚Äù can work wonders.

Level up your landing page with Lovable by adding rich interactive experiences, responsive UIs, and real working product previews.

P5.js + Custom Animations

For visual magic like orbiting horses or flickering stars:

- Use P5.js sketches in hero sections
- Animate backgrounds (fix opacity + contrast for visibility)
- Add particle effects or timeline scroll animations

üõ† If it fails to render, use:

- Chat mode for debugging
- ‚ÄúImplement plan‚Äù from code block
- Ask it to reset + use working reference code

Use Chat Mode to debug P5.js when things break.

Customize Favicon

Favicons need to be 64x64 `.ico` or `.png`.

**Steps:**

1. Generate an icon on Replicate
2. Resize via [favicon.io](http://favicon.io/) or similar
3. Paste image into prompt:

Copy

```
Change the website favicon to this.
```

Contact Forms that Actually Work

Collect emails and respond automatically with **Resend**.

**Use case:**

- Contact Sales form
- Confirmation email to user
- Notification email to your team

**Prompt:**

Copy

```
Implement a contact form that uses Resend.
Send a confirmation email to the user and a notification to my team.
```

Need to limit usage or detect abuse? Add IP tracking with Supabase fingerprinting.

What Type of Landing Page Should You Build?

Here‚Äôs what you can build:

- Blog
- Portfolio
- SaaS site
- Nonprofit
- Course signup
- Event promotion

üëâ Try building one of each to get comfortable.

Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) 101

Your landing page‚Äôs goal = 1 action.

**That might be:**

- Booking a call
- Buying a seat (like HorseX)
- Signing up for a waitlist

**CRO best practices:**

- Limit CTAs
- Keep headlines clear
- Match layout to audience expectations
- Use social proof + trust signals

Lovable understands the term ‚ÄúCRO optimized,‚Äù so use it in your prompts.

Static vs Dynamic Pages

Lovable builds static pages by default.

To make it dynamic:

- Add forms (e.g., to collect leads)
- Connect to Supabase
- Add checkout using Stripe
- CMS integration (e.g., with Strapi)

Final Polish = Razzle Dazzle

Here‚Äôs what separates a 2Ksitefroma2K site from a 2Ksitefroma

10K site:

- Animations
- Fonts + spacing
- Branding consistency
- Copywriting polish
- Loading speeds
- SEO setup (Lovable now supports robots.txt and OG tags)

Add Real Product Previews

Let visitors **test your product directly** from the landing page. You can embed mini-apps using Supabase and external APIs like GROQ.

**Example:** A ‚ÄúMake it professional‚Äù email previewer powered by the GROQ API:

- Connect to Supabase first to avoid wiring issues later
- Use `chat mode` to help Lovable understand and implement new APIs
- Ask for fingerprinting or usage limits via IP if needed

**Prompt:**

Copy

```
Add a section where users can preview our AI email assistant.
Connect to Supabase. Use GROQ API for email enhancement.
```

Use 21st.dev for Beautiful Animations

Enhance your visual design with high-quality animations and components:

- Floating glowing particles
- Scroll-based sticky sections
- Timeline animations
- Logo carousels
- Modal popups for video demos

If animations don‚Äôt show up, use chat mode to debug or re-implement from scratch. You can also upload screenshots and say:

_‚ÄúPlease animate this background section.‚Äù_

Add Modal Popups (Videos & More)

Want to show a demo without cluttering the hero?

**Use modals:**

- Embed YouTube or demo videos
- Trigger on button click (e.g. ‚ÄúWatch Demo‚Äù)
- Common prompt term: `modal popup`

**Prompt:**

Copy

```
When the ‚ÄúWatch Demo‚Äù button is clicked, open a modal popup with this video.
```

Add a Trust Section with Real Logos

Social proof matters.

- Create a ‚ÄúTrusted By‚Äù section with animated company logos.
- Ensure logos stay as image files, not SVG paths.
- Avoid grayed-out overlays.

**Prompt:**

Copy

```
Add a ‚ÄúTrusted by‚Äù section using real company logos.
Keep them as images, not SVGs. Use 21st.dev animations.
```

Hero Animations & UI Polish

Don‚Äôt settle for static hero sections:

- Animate words (cycle between phrases)
- Add floating shapes (circles, gradients)
- Match color palette across hero, headings, and timeline

Example prompts:

Copy

```
Animate the word in the hero title to cycle between "intelligence" and "assistance"
Add floating purple circles in the background
Make the heading text use the primary purple gradient
```

Sticky Navigation + Custom Navbar

Want smooth scrolling to sections?

- Use a sticky nav bar
- Replace default nav with one from [21st.dev](http://21st.dev/)
- Make sure it links to **sections**, not new pages

Use screenshots and say: _‚ÄúMake this navbar scroll to page sections and match our theme.‚Äù_

Mobile Responsiveness

Lovable auto-generates mobile-friendly pages‚Äîbut test and tweak:

- Add margin and padding via visual edit
- Test modals, animations, and layouts on mobile

What‚Äôs the Parallax Effect?

**Parallax** creates a sense of **depth** by having background elements move at a different speed than foreground ones as you scroll. It‚Äôs like walking through a forest in a video game ‚Äî trees in the front move faster than mountains in the back.

**Why it‚Äôs cool:**

- Adds immersion
- Makes your landing page feel more dynamic and interactive
- Visually separates sections in a subtle way

**Prompt Example:**

Copy

```
Add a parallax scroll effect to the background of the hero section.
Make the stars move slower than the text and images.
```

Use it sparingly. Too much parallax = overwhelming.

What‚Äôs Isometry (Isometric Design)?

**Isometric design** creates a 3D-like effect using 2D graphics, typically at a 30¬∞ angle. Think of games like _Monument Valley_ or old-school _Sim City_. Everything looks ‚Äútilted‚Äù but perfectly aligned ‚Äî no perspective distortion.

**Why use it:**

- Clean, futuristic aesthetic
- Makes your app visuals look more sophisticated
- Great for tech, data, and AI themes

**Prompt Example:**

Copy

```
Use isometric illustrations for the product feature section.
Make the graphics look like a futuristic dashboard in 3D.
```

You can also import isometric illustrations from:

- [Storyset](https://storyset.com/)
- [Icons8 Isometric](https://icons8.com/icons/set/isometric)
- [3D Icons Library](https://www.3dicons.com/)

Isometric graphics pair really well with **glassmorphism** or dark-themed UIs for modern SaaS pages.

- Learned how to debug issues effectively.

2

Building Interactive UIs

In this module, we‚Äôll cover components, reusable UI elements, design improvements, and debugging best practices.

Understanding Components

Components in Lovable help organize UI elements into modular and reusable parts. Instead of having all UI elements in a single page (e.g., a 400-line dashboard), we break them into components such as:

- **Sidebar**
- **Welcome Card**
- **Quote Card**
- **Notes Section**

This structure improves efficiency when making edits since changes apply only to specific components rather than the entire page.

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/use-case/prototype\#creating-and-using-components%3A)  Creating and Using Components:

1

Identify Large UI Sections

Look for UI parts that repeat or are too large.

2

Refactor Into Components

Use Lovable‚Äôs chat mode to scan the code and suggest an optimized structure.

3

Reuse Components

Copy and paste components across pages for consistency.

Editing UI Efficiently

1

Modify Individual Components

Instead of modifying the full dashboard, edit smaller components like the **Welcome Card**.

Run a prompt:

_‚ÄúUpdate the copy in the Welcome Card to make it more engaging.‚Äù_

2

Use Chat Mode for Refactoring

Ask Lovable to refactor large UI sections into smaller components.

Example:

_‚ÄúRefactor the dashboard into smaller, cleaner components.‚Äù_

- Example: _‚ÄúRefactor the dashboard into smaller, cleaner components.‚Äù_

Enhancing UI with Pre-Built Components

If you‚Äôre not a designer, leveraging pre-built styles can improve your app‚Äôs appearance.

1

Using 21st.dev for UI Inspiration

1

Step 1

Visit [21st.dev](https://21st.dev/?tab=components&sort=recommended) to explore pre-built UI components.

2

Step 2

Choose a design, copy its prompt for Lovable, and integrate it into your project.

2

Creating Global Styles

1

Step 1

Modify an element on the project

for eg: _‚ÄúSet a button as Rainbow Button‚Äù._

2

Step 2

Add this system prompt in the project settings‚Äô knowledge to ensure all new buttons follow this style:

‚ÄúWhen creating components, make sure to always use our global rainbow button‚Äù.

3

Step 3

Everytime you add a button, this pre-set style will be respected.

Redesigning the Dashboard

To update the dashboard layout:

1

Step 1

Find a **design you like** (e.g., on [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/)).

2

Step 2

**Screenshot the relevant section** and upload it to Lovable.

3

Step 3

**Provide clear instructions**, such as:

_‚ÄúRefactor the dashboard layout based on this design.‚Äù_

‚Äú _Place notes in a left-hand sidebar, and open them in a side-by-side editable view.‚Äù_

Implementing Real-Time Updates

1

Enable Real-Time Sync for Notes

1

Step 1

Run a prompt

_‚ÄúEnable real-time updates for notes so that changes reflect instantly.‚Äù_

2

Step 2

Ensure data updates in both the **sidebar** and **editing panel**.

2

Debugging UI Issues

Use chat mode to scan the implementation and fix missing updates.

Example:

_‚ÄúWhen editing the title in the side-by-side view, it doesn‚Äôt save. Fix this issue.‚Äù_

Refining the Note Editing Experience

1

Use Mobbin for Real-World UI Examples

Search for ‚Äúnote-taking UI‚Äù to see how popular apps design their interfaces.

Example:

A clean, minimalistic note editor with large titles and a dropdown for tags.

2

Applying UI Improvements

1

Step 1

Ensure the title is **large and prominent**.

2

Step 2

Add **tags via a dropdown**, similar to the reference UI.

Example prompt:

_‚ÄúRedesign the note editor to match this screenshot. Use a large title, white space for content, and dropdown-based tags.‚Äù_

Debugging and Final Touches

1

Fix UI Bugs

Ensure all UI elements update correctly when modified.

Run a prompt:

_‚ÄúFix the issue where note tags don‚Äôt save after editing.‚Äù_

2

Optimize Button Styling

Adjust button and input styling to match the intended design.

Example:

_‚ÄúEnsure all buttons use the global Rainbow Button style.‚Äù_

Congratulations üéâ

By the end of this module, you should have:

- Refactored large UI sections into reusable components.
- Implemented a polished note-taking dashboard.
- Used real-time updates for better user experience.
- Refined the design using external inspirations and best practices.

Use Cases

SaaS

Welcome to the ultimate guide for building SaaS applications using Lovable.dev.

This documentation will walk you through building, scaling, and deploying fully working SaaS products without writing a single line of code‚Äîunless you want to.

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/use-case/saas\#step-by-step-process)  Step-by-Step Process

1

Start with the UI

**Why**: Begin with the structure and layout of your app to minimize errors and plan ahead.

**How**:

- Write a prompt that outlines pages and user flow.
- Optionally add screenshots (Figma, Excalidraw).
- Focus only on front-end initially.

**Prompt Example**:

Copy

```
Create an AI journaling app with:
- Landing page with Get Started CTA
- Main app with sidebar to view/edit logs
- Chat page to ask questions based on past entries
```

2

Connect the Backend (Supabase)

**Why**: Store and retrieve user data securely.

**How**:

- Press the Supabase button in the Lovable editor
- Create a Supabase project and connect it
- Disable email verification in dev mode for speed
- Define database schema for logs, users, meals, etc.

You own your data and schema. Lovable just simplifies setup.

3

Add Authentication

Lovable adds email/password login by default. You can:

- Redirect to sign-up when users click CTA
- Link entries/meals to authenticated users

**Prompt Example**:

Copy

```
Add sign up and login. Redirect to sign-up on 'Get Started'.
```

4

Build Core Features

Each app feature is built incrementally:

#### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/use-case/saas\#journaling-app%3A)  Journaling App:

- Rate mood/energy/productivity
- Save & update entries
- View past logs in sidebar

#### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/use-case/saas\#calorie-tracker%3A)  Calorie Tracker:

- Input or upload meal
- GPT-4 estimates nutrition (protein, fat, carbs, kcal)
- Visual stats with icons + circular progress bars

- Use the select tool to target specific sections
- Upload screenshots to guide layout or logic

5

Integrate AI (OpenAI)

Use GPT-4 for:

- Journaling analysis
- Meal breakdowns
- Conversational insights

**How**:

- Set up Edge Functions in Supabase
- Add OpenAI API Key via Lovable‚Äôs secure backend prompt
- Confirm AI has access to dynamic user data (entries/meals)

**Prompt Example**:

Copy

```
Create chat page using GPT-4.
Include journal entries in the prompt dynamically.
Use function calling to return structured nutrition data.
```

6

Add Payments with Stripe (Optional)

Lovable supports **Stripe subscription payments** with edge functions.

**How**:

1. Create a Stripe product + price ID
2. Add Stripe API Key to Lovable
3. Define logic: only paying users can access main app
4. Add a customer portal to manage billing

**Prompt Example**:

Copy

```
Add recurring payments via Stripe.
If not subscribed, redirect user to checkout.
```

Stripe setup requires a Stripe account. Use test mode while developing.

Tips & tricks

Best Practices

This guide helps all users‚Äînew or experienced‚Äîget up to speed quickly and avoid common pitfalls when building on Lovable.

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/user-guides/best-practice\#1-set-your-foundation%3A-use-the-knowledge-file)  1\. Set Your Foundation: Use the Knowledge File

**Why it matters:** The [_Knowledge_](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/knowledge) file is your project‚Äôs brain. It gets sent with every prompt and helps the AI understand the full context.

**What to include:**

- Your product vision (think of it like a PRD)
- User journeys and personas
- Key features and functionality
- Design systems and UI guidance
- Role-specific behavior (e.g. Admin, User, Investor)

You can auto-generate a Knowledge file via Chat mode:

Copy

```
Generate knowledge for my project at T=0 based on the features I‚Äôve already implemented.
```

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/user-guides/best-practice\#2-prompting-best-practices)  2\. [Prompting](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/prompting-one) Best Practices

**Clear, verbose prompts = better output.** Think of the AI like your engineering partner‚Äîit only knows what you tell it.

**Prompting tips:**

- Be specific: Mention the exact page (e.g. `/dashboard`) and expected behavior.

- Use natural language





Copy









```
I want users with the role Investor to access this component, but not Admins.
```

- Add screenshots: Especially useful for describing bugs or UX issues.

- Add guardrails: Tell the AI what **not** to touch. E.g.





Copy









```
Do not edit /shared/Layout.tsx.
```

- Repeat important instructions across prompts. The AI‚Äôs memory can be limiting.

- Avoid trying to implement 5 things at once. Break work into smaller, testable chunks. Use Chat Mode between each block to validate before moving on.





Copy









```
**Feature Breakdown Template:**
Create the new page
Add UI layout
Connect the data
Add logic + edge cases
Test per role
```

- If your app has multiple roles (e.g. Admin, Investor, Startup), always define _which role_ the prompt applies to. This helps avoid bugs caused by shared logic/components.





Copy









```
As an Investor, I want to view the company dashboard, but I shouldn‚Äôt be able to edit it. Please isolate this feature to the Investor role only.
```


## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/user-guides/best-practice\#3-use-chat-mode-early-and-often)  3\. Use Chat Mode Early and Often

[**Chat mode**](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/labs#chat-mode) = your AI co-pilot. It helps you debug, brainstorm, and plan implementations‚Äîwithout editing your code until you‚Äôre ready.

**When to switch to Chat Mode:**

- After 2‚Äì3 failed ‚ÄúTry to Fix‚Äù attempts

- When debugging complex logic or database issues

- When planning new features





Copy









```
Suggest 3 ways to implement X
```


**Workflow tip:**

Some users like to use Chat Mode for 60‚Äì70% of your time. Only click ‚ÄúImplement the plan‚Äù when you‚Äôre fully satisfied.

If you forget using the Chat mode, this format improves output consistency and prevents collateral edits.

Copy

```
On page /settings, implement [feature]. The expected behavior is [XYZ]. Please don‚Äôt touch component A, layout B, or shared logic unless necessary. Follow best practices from Tailwind / Supabase / X.
```

To avoid unwanted code execution:

Copy

```
Investigate but don‚Äôt write code yet.
```

Copy

```
Suggest 3 ways to solve this without changing anything.
```

This keeps control in your hands.

When AI enters a ‚Äúloop,‚Äù use this sequence to avoid endless cycles of patching broken code:

1. Switch to Chat mode

2. Paste the error screenshot

3. Say:





Copy









```
Please investigate this without breaking other features. If needed, revert to the last working version and fix from there.
```


## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/user-guides/best-practice\#4-avoid-common-pitfalls-with-supabase)  4\. Avoid Common Pitfalls with Supabase

**Heads-up:** [Supabase](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/supabase) does not revert cleanly. If you revert a version, your database schema may break.

**Best practices:**

- Connect Supabase **after** front-end is stable

- If you must revert, prompt the AI:





Copy









```
Please validate the SQL schema at T=0 and ensure no breaking changes have occurred.
```

- Always test database-linked features before publishing


## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/user-guides/best-practice\#5-use-visual-edit-for-quick-ui-fixes)  5\. Use Visual Edit for Quick UI Fixes

The [**Visual Edit tool**](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/visual-edit) is free and fast. Use it instead of prompts for:

- Changing text, colors, fonts, layout tweaks
- Editing multiple small elements at once
- Safe, credit-free commits (with undo available)

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/user-guides/best-practice\#6-use-github-%2B-version-control-wisely)  6\. Use [GitHub](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/git-integration) \+ Version Control Wisely

- Every edit is a commit. Use **pinning** to mark stable versions. After every working feature: **Pin it**

- After every bug: **Compare versions visually.** You can prompt with:





Copy









```
Compare version at T‚Äì1 to T‚Äì0. What changed? What might be breaking?
```

- Come back to a stable version if you feel the AI has broken too much things.

- Use **GitHub branching** at your own risk. Avoid deleting branches before switching back to `main` in Lovable to prevent project sync issues.


## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/user-guides/best-practice\#7-when-all-else-fails%2C-remix)  7\. When All Else Fails, Remix

Many users realize: doing it all over takes less time the second time.

- [Remix](https://docs.lovable.dev/user-guides/quickstart#remix-an-existing-project:~:text=you%20to%20reuse-,the,-current%20state%20of) creates a clean copy of your project at T=0.
- Rebuild with better prompting + clearer knowledge
- Use your old project as reference only

**Use cases:**

- You‚Äôre stuck in a buggy loop
- You want to restart clean with preserved history
- You need to disconnect Superbase and try a new path

Remixing requires disconnecting Superbase first.

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/user-guides/best-practice\#8-stay-patient%2C-stay-calm)  8\. Stay Patient, Stay Calm

You‚Äôre not alone. AI can be magical one moment and frustrating the next. The final 5% of any build is often the slowest‚Äîbut the most important.

**Golden rule:**

Take your time with prompts. Re-check everything. Break work into small, testable blocks. The more precise your inputs, the better your outputs.

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/user-guides/best-practice\#9-use-the-docs-%26-ask-for-help)  9\. Use the Docs & Ask for Help

- [Documentation](https://docs.lovable.dev/) contains walkthroughs, templates, SEO tips, integrations, and more. You can ask questions directly in the doc AI assistant.
- Join the [Discord community](https://discord.gg/lovable-dev) for peer support.
- When ready, submit your project to [Lovable Launch](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/launched).

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/user-guides/best-practice\#10-bonus-tips)  10\. Bonus Tips

- Add a voice note prompt using dictation (e.g. On Mac, use the mic to dictate long prompts) for long prompts. You‚Äôll craft better input faster‚Äîespecially useful when frustrated or tired.

- Use the ‚Äú `I am frustrated‚Ä¶`‚Äù prompt pattern to nudge better AI focus

- After a major edit, always recheck multiple roles and their behavior (especially with conditional logic)

- Store stable versions as fallbacks for quick debugging

- If you‚Äôre seeing unexpected side effects, this helps avoid bugs caused by overly generic logic.





Copy









```
Create a component specifically for [role X] and do not reuse shared components unless clearly scoped.

Tips & tricks

From Idea to Working App

> **‚ÄúI have no clue what I‚Äôm doing‚Ä¶ but I know exactly what I want to build.‚Äù**

If that sounds like you, you‚Äôre in the right place.

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/user-guides/from-idea-to-app\#who-this-is-for)  Who This Is For

You‚Äôve got an idea.

You‚Äôve tried AI tools, written notes, maybe even opened a few projects.

But you‚Äôre stuck between inspiration and execution.

**This guide will help you:**

- Go from vague concept to concrete product
- Avoid common mistakes
- Use Lovable the smart way‚Äîespecially if you‚Äôre not a developer

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/user-guides/from-idea-to-app\#the-common-pitfall%3A-building-before-you-plan)  The Common Pitfall: Building Before You Plan

A lot of users fall into the same trap: `They start building before they‚Äôve clarified what they‚Äôre building.`

**The result?**

- Errors on top of errors
- Confused AI agents and AI-generated errors
- Projects that veer off track or feel ‚Äú `too far gone to fix`‚Äù

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/user-guides/from-idea-to-app\#best-practices-for-turning-ideas-into-real-products)  Best Practices for Turning Ideas Into Real Products

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/user-guides/from-idea-to-app\#1-start-outside-lovable)  1\. Start Outside Lovable

Many builders‚Äîincluding livestream guest MP‚Äîspend time shaping their ideas _before_ opening Lovable.

Try this:

- Record a voice note explaining your idea naturally (MP uses Granola for this)
- Paste it into GPT or Claude to get an expanded version in clear product terms
- Ask AI to act as a designer, PM, or developer and critique or co-draft a PRD (Product Requirements Document)

Use Lovable when you‚Äôre ready to go from clear vision to working prototype.

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/user-guides/from-idea-to-app\#2-write-it-out-first)  2\. **Write It Out First**

Before you prompt the AI, spend 15 minutes writing:

- What does your product do?
- Who it‚Äôs for (even if it‚Äôs just you)
- What the _simplest & minimum version_ should include

**Turn this into a list of features or use cases:**

Write it as a list of user stories or features and feed it into chat mode or GPT to get a PRD (Product Requirements Document).

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/user-guides/from-idea-to-app\#3-choose-your-build-style-wisely)  3\. Choose Your Build Style Wisely

There are two valid approaches to building with Lovable:

1. **Front-End First (Recommended for Beginners)**
   - Start with mock data
   - Build layouts, flows, and logic without connecting a database
   - Once satisfied, plug in Supabase and go live
2. **Back-to-Front**:

   - Connect Supabase from Day 1
   - Build and test each feature one by one
   - Best for advanced users comfortable debugging

If you‚Äôre new, **choose front-end first.** You‚Äôll:

- Avoid complex SQL errors
- Iterate faster
- Stay focused on design + usability

MP used front-end first for speed, clarity, and debugging ease. It helped him learn fast and ship quicker.

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/user-guides/from-idea-to-app\#4-use-chat-mode-as-a-thought-partner)  4\. Use Chat Mode as a Thought Partner

Chat Mode isn‚Äôt just a chatbot‚Äîit‚Äôs your project-aware assistant.

It knows your files, your database schema, your logs.

Use it to:

- Debug issues with context
- Break down vague ideas into structured components
- Brainstorm, plan, and iterate
- Translate vague ideas into working flows

Try this prompt:

Copy

```
I want to build a dog breeding management app. Here's what I need it to do: [list]. Can you break this down into steps or components to build?

I‚Äôm building a job coaching app. Here‚Äôs what I want it to do: [list]. What‚Äôs the simplest version to test?
```

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/user-guides/from-idea-to-app\#5-break-it-down-into-bricks)  5\. Break It Down into Bricks

Don‚Äôt build everything at once. Split your idea into **bricks**:

- Each brick = one feature, component, or flow
- Build one at a time
- Test, refine, then move on

Ask Chat Mode to help plan this with prompts like:

Copy

```
Here‚Äôs my app idea. Can you break it into features or steps I should build?
```

Copy

```
Break this idea into buildable features I can test one at a time.
```

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/user-guides/from-idea-to-app\#6-prompt-with-purpose)  6\. **Prompt with Purpose**

Before each prompt, ask:

Copy

```
What am I trying to build right now?
```

Be specific. Avoid mid-conversation shifts‚ÄîAI needs consistent intent to help you properly.

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/user-guides/from-idea-to-app\#7-avoid-the-infinite-error-loop)  7\. Avoid the Infinite Error Loop

Stuck? Don‚Äôt click ‚ÄúTry to Fix‚Äù 10 times.

Instead:

- Open browser dev tools (Console tab)
- Copy the actual error
- Paste it into Chat Mode to investigate
- Or remix the project without your database to simplify debugging

Lovable now reads console logs automatically‚Äîno copy-paste needed for most cases.

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/user-guides/from-idea-to-app\#8-remix-if-things-get-messy)  8\. Remix If Things Get Messy

Projects evolve. If things feel tangled:

- Remix your project (it clones the project, you keep the original)
- Start fresh with what you‚Äôve learned
- Keep the new build focused and structured
- Keep what works. Drop what doesn‚Äôt.

### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/user-guides/from-idea-to-app\#9-use-real-validation%2C-fast)  9\. **Use Real Validation, Fast**

A user told us he didn‚Äôt build to sell. He sent a rough prototype to 10 users in DMs. One asked to pay immediately. By Friday, Stripe was integrated.

Validate by:

- Asking real users, ‚ÄúWould this help you?‚Äù
- Getting quick feedback, not perfection
- Letting real interest guide your next steps

[MP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwHNw8aeYCI&ab_channel=Lovable) built 100+ throwaway projects:

- Message-for-a-stranger app
- 90s nostalgia generator
- AI interview prep tool

Each one helped him test a skill:

- Building UI with no backend
- Adding profanity filters
- Connecting AI APIs
- Managing user flow

Lesson:

**Build things that don‚Äôt need to exist‚Äîso you‚Äôre ready when something does.**

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/user-guides/from-idea-to-app\#builder%E2%80%99s-checklist)  Builder‚Äôs Checklist

1. Write your idea in 5-10 bullet points
2. List out core features (use bullets) in an MVP (minimum viable product)
3. Decide: Front-End First or Back-to-Front
4. Use Chat Mode to co-plan and debug
5. Build in bricks: 1 feature at a time
6. Only connect Supabase when ready
7. Remix if errors pile up
8. Get feedback before going live

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/user-guides/from-idea-to-app\#final-tip%3A-you%E2%80%99re-the-first-user)  Final Tip: You‚Äôre the First User

- Design for yourself first.
- Test like your future users would.
- Think like a product designer.

And remember: you‚Äôre building something only you could imagine.

> You don‚Äôt need to know how to code.
>
> You just need a clear idea, a good plan, and a little patience.
>
> Lovable will help with the rest.

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/user-guides/messaging-limits\#common-issues-and-troubleshooting)  Common Issues and Troubleshooting

Pricing Changes or Charges

Lovable sends community and email notifications about any upcoming pricing changes. Please ensure your email is up-to-date in your account settings.

Errors During Payment Setup

Occasionally, payment setups may fail due to issues with Stripe. If this occurs, double-check your payment details and retry. If problems persist, contact our support team for assistance.

Change payment cards

You can update your payment method anytime by navigating to **Account Settings > Plans & Billing** and managing your details through Stripe.

Paid Users Losing Access

This typically happens due to billing issues (e.g., expired cards). Ensure your payment method is valid to avoid interruptions.

Resolving Overages or Refunds

If you experience message overages or require a refund, reach out to our support team. We handle these on a case-by-case basis to ensure a fair resolution.

'Chat Mode' credits consumption

A few weeks ago, we introduced **Chat Mode** as a (accessible: **Account > Settings > Labs**), and the feedback from early testers has been overwhelmingly positive. We‚Äôve since expanded its capabilities, making it feel like you‚Äôre chatting with a technology expert who understands your projects and goals inside and out.

However, these advanced features come with additional costs, so **messages sent in Chat Mode will now count towards your message limit**:

- 1 Chat Mode message = 1 Edit Mode message = 1 message
- All pricing tiers have access to Chat Mode
- There will be no separate message count in settings for Chat Mode

We‚Äôre excited to keep improving Chat Mode and appreciate your continued feedback!

'Try to Fix' button counting as messages

Messages triggered by ‚ÄúAsk the AI to fix‚Äù don‚Äôt count toward your usage limits only if pressed on the button. If you are trying to [fix errors](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/troubleshooting) with an additional prompt, that counts as message credit.

All other messages count regardless of their outcome.

Messages roll over

Messages do not roll over. Unused messages will **not accumulate** from:

- Day to day (for the free tier)
- or month to month (for the paid tiers)

You can remix an existing public project or one of your own. Remixing allows you to reuse the current state of a project as a starting point and build upon it. It‚Äôs a great way to explore new ideas, make adjustments, or iterate with different changes while preserving the original version.

Note that it is not possible to remix projects when Supabase is connected.

Using Figma

If you have a design in Figma,

1. **Using screenshots:** Take a screenshot of any part of it. You can paste the screenshot directly into Lovable or drag-and-drop the image file. Once you press Enter, Lovable will convert your design into functional code.
2. **Using Builder.io integration:** First, structure your Figma design using Auto-Layout and clear layer naming. Then, open the Builder.io plugin in Figma, select your design, and click ‚ÄúOpen in Lovable‚Äù to generate a fully functional app. [More information here.](https://lovable.dev/blog/2025-01-22-figma-to-lovable-builder-io-native-integration)

Build an AI-Powered Calorie Tracking WebApp

[iframe](https://www.youtube.com/embed/c0zhLzcVJRI?si=7vcZf5eoxIobOxdE)

This tutorial, we‚Äôll walk you through creating an AI-powered calorie tracking app with [Lovable](https://docs.lovable.dev/lovable-f9060f1e/lovable-f9060f1e/editor/main#build-an-ai-powered-calorie-tracking-webapp), complete with authentication, a beautiful responsive design, OpenAI integration, and deployment to production.

1

Setting Up the Foundation

The foundation of any Lovable project is a good prompt. For this app, here‚Äôs an example:

Copy

```
Create a calorie tracking app with the following features:
Landing page, dashboard, and a meals page.
Input fields for meal descriptions or images, with analysis powered by GPT-4.
Daily progress tracking and integration with Supabase for authentication and database management.
Beautiful and mobile-responsive UI.
```

Once Lovable generates the UI skeleton:

- Review the navigation setup and landing page design.
- Iterate on the prompt to refine the layout and ensure mobile responsiveness.

Be explicit about starting with the UI. Lovable works best when tasks are broken into clear steps. For instance, outline navigation, page structures, and design themes early in the prompt

2

Designing the UI

Lovable emphasizes a step-by-step approach, akin to constructing a building:

- Start with **scaffolding**: Plan your app structure (e.g., user experience flow, page layout).
- Add the **first layer**: Create empty pages with basic design elements.
- Refine the **details**: Add colors, animations, and mobile responsiveness.

If you have pre-made designs in [Figma](https://docs.lovable.dev/user-guides/video-tutorials), you can take screenshots and include them in your Lovable prompt. Providing high-resolution images ensures better results.

3

Integrate Supabase for Backend and Authentication

Once the UI is ready, it‚Äôs time to add backend functionality:

1. Set up a [**Supabase**](https://docs.lovable.dev/user-guides/video-tutorials) **account** and create a project.
2. Link it to Lovable by pressing the ‚ÄúConnect Supabase‚Äù button.
3. For data storage, Lovable will generate SQL tables. For instance:

- A `profiles` table to store user information.
- A `meals` table linked to users for tracking daily entries.

Use row-level security (RLS) rules in Supabase to ensure user privacy. Lovable can handle this for you automatically.

4

Integrating OpenAI for Meal Analysis

The magic of this app lies in its AI capabilities. To analyze meals:

1. Obtain an [OpenAI API key](https://docs.lovable.dev/user-guides/video-tutorials) from your developer dashboard.
2. Use [GPT-4](https://docs.lovable.dev/user-guides/video-tutorials) for analyzing meal descriptions or images.
3. Ensure API keys are securely stored in Edge functions to prevent unauthorized access.

**Features to include:**

- **Analyze meal descriptions**: Estimate nutritional values (calories, protein, carbs, fat).
- **Image recognition**: Upload a meal photo, and GPT-4 will extract a description and nutritional data.

_Pro Tips for OpenAI Integration:_

- Use **function calling** for structured responses, ensuring data is formatted correctly for database insertion.
- Test the functionality by asking the app to analyze simple meal entries like ‚Äú2 eggs.‚Äù

5

Implementing Payments with Stripe

To monetize the app, add subscription-based payments:

1. Create a [Stripe](https://docs.lovable.dev/user-guides/video-tutorials) account and set up a product (e.g., ‚ÄúStandard Plan‚Äù for $12/month).
2. Integrate Stripe with Lovable by adding the API key and product price ID.
3. Redirect non-paying users to the landing page. Only paying users can access the main app.

_Additional Tips:_

- Enable Stripe‚Äôs **customer portal** to let users manage subscriptions (e.g., cancel or update payment methods).
- Test payments in Stripe‚Äôs test mode using the provided test credit card details.

3. **Interactive hover effects** where images react to user movements.

#### [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/user-guides/video-tutorials\#how-to-implement-animated-effects)  **How to Implement Animated Effects**

To create these effects, users followed this simple process:

- **Define the desired animation:**

Make the background interactive with floating elements that move away when hovered over.

- **Use p5.js to generate effects:**
  - Implement a chromatic smoke pattern.
  - Swap out static images for dynamic flag animations.

AI-Generated Courses

To make learning interactive, we implemented an AI-driven course generation system using [OpenAI‚Äôs GPT model](https://docs.lovable.dev/user-guides/video-tutorials). Here‚Äôs how it works:

1. Users select a topic (e.g., ‚ÄúQuestions to ask at a barbecue‚Äù).
2. Lovable calls an [OpenAI Edge function](https://docs.lovable.dev/user-guides/video-tutorials) to generate **10 engaging Spanish-language questions**.
3. Users complete quizzes, track progress, and receive AI feedback on their answers.

2

Enhancing User Engagement

- **Dynamically Generated Questions**: Each quiz is AI-generated, ensuring fresh, unique content every time.
- **Interactive Feedback**: The AI provides explanations for correct and incorrect answers to improve learning.
- **Progress Tracking**: Users can save and revisit courses, enhancing retention and practice.

3

Enhancing Visual Engagement with Replicate

To add a visual learning element, we integrated [**Replicate‚Äôs Flux Schnell**](https://docs.lovable.dev/user-guides/video-tutorials) image generation model:

- **Automated Course Banners**: Every course dynamically generates an image matching the topic.
- **Visually Immersive Experience**: AI-driven visuals enhance user engagement and retention.

- **Color Palette**: A **Tailwind CSS blue** scheme to symbolize travel and discovery.
- **Styling Inspiration**: Experimented with **neo-brutalism**, tweaking contrast, shadows, and borders to create a visually engaging UI.

4

Building a Cohesive User Experience

Using Lovable, we ensured **visual consistency** across the app:

- **Landing Page**: AI-generated with a dynamic, engaging hero section.
- **Dashboard & Course Pages**: Styled to match the brand‚Äôs identity.
- **Iterative Styling**: Applied **neo-brutalist** elements to test different design styles.
- **User Flow Testing**: Ensured seamless navigation from signup to real-time chat.

Lovable 2.0

We‚Äôre so excited to launch **Lovable 2.0**! This one‚Äôs all about collaboration, security, and giving you more control.

![Lovable Two Point Zero Pn](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lovable-f9060f1e/images/lovable-two-point-zero.png)

- We‚Äôve rebranded! New logo, brighter colors, and a much cleaner UI. Go check it out below‚Äî we hope it feels like a glow-up.
- [Teams](https://docs.lovable.dev/user-guides/teams): Real-time collaboration is finally here! Invite others to co-edit apps or create shared team workspaces.
- [**Simplified Pricing**](https://docs.lovable.dev/user-guides/messaging-limits#free-vs-paid-plans-comparison) with two clean options: Pro starts at $30/month and Teams starts at $30/month.
- **Security Scan:** Lovable now checks for vulnerabilities when you publish (if you‚Äôre connected to Supabase). This is just the beginning of our work to make vibe coding safer by default.

It doesn‚Äôt make edits, but it _can_ help you reason through problems, plan features, inspect logs, query databases, and more. Think of it as your smart, hands-off pair programming buddy.

This is a big step forward ‚Äî and we‚Äôre just getting started.

Thanks so much for being on this journey with us

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/faq\#debugging-%26-troubleshooting)  Debugging & Troubleshooting

What should I do when I hit an error that won‚Äôt go away?

**Great question!** You‚Äôre not alone‚Äîeveryone runs into these loops sometimes.

Here‚Äôs what we recommend:

1

Try to fix (free)

**Try fixing the error twice** using edit mode or chat mode.

2

Chat Mode

If it still loops or creates more issues, **switch fully to chat mode** and debug by explaining what you‚Äôre seeing.

Use prompts like:

- ‚ÄúExplain the error and how to fix it.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúList the steps you‚Äôre taking and why.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs different between this and your previous solution?‚Äù

3

Restore

If that doesn‚Äôt work, **restore a previous working version**, **remix the project**, or **report it** via Discord or paid support.

Bonus tip:

**Add a Knowledge File** early on with your vision, rules, and structure. That context helps the AI stay on track.

Where can I get help if I'm stuck?

- Use [**Chat Mode**](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/labs#chat-mode) for AI assistance.
- Check [**documentation**](https://docs.lovable.dev/) for guidance.
- Join the [**Discord community**](https://discord.gg/lovable-dev) for real-time help.

What should I do when my app breaks?

Here‚Äôs a safe recovery pattern:

1. **Version tag** every stable moment.
2. If something breaks, **don‚Äôt keep building**‚Äîrevert.
3. Remix from a working front-end version and re-implement backend or complex logic gradually.

How do I avoid prompt confusion or loops?

Give _more_ context, not less. Long, structured prompts work better:

- Describe what the user should see, click, and do.
- Clarify what part of the app it affects.
- Be explicit: ‚ÄúAdd a login button that redirects to dashboard after login (Google, Slack, email).‚Äù

What support options do I have?

2 options here:

- **Free users**: Community help via [Discord](https://discord.gg/lovable-dev).
- [**Paid users**](https://lovable.dev/support): Access to AI-powered support _plus_ the ‚ÄúSpeak to a human‚Äù option anytime (platform-related issues). We respond same-day for paid users.

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/faq\#ai-and-automation)  AI and Automation

Can I add third-party APIs to my project?

Yes, you can integrate APIs like OpenAI, Stripe, and more by specifying them in your prompt.

Can I store sensitive API keys in Lovable?

No! Never enter your API keys directly in Lovable. If you‚Äôre integrating with an API, we recommend you use Supabase secrets to store your API keys, in combination with the [Supabase Edge Functions](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/supabase).

How does Lovable AI remember context?

Lovable processes recent messages to maintain context. For the best results, include relevant details in each prompt to ensure clarity and accuracy.

Can Lovable build complex B2B SaaS apps?

Yes! Lovable supports:

- **Workflow automation** for business processes.
- **Role-based access controls** for different user levels.
- **Document generation** with built-in logic for approvals and signatures.
- & so much more.

Why did Lovable switch from Python to Go?

Lovable migrated [from Python to Go](https://lovable.dev/blog/from-python-to-go) to improve performance, scalability, and developer experience. Go enables faster processing, lower latency, and better efficiency, especially for handling large-scale AI-driven tasks.

What is the character limit for prompts?

Due to AI constraints, prompts are limited to **approximately 180K tokens (‚âà720K characters).**

Can I run my AI model on Lovable without an API?

Probably not. Most AI models require an API for proper integration.

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/faq\#pricing-%26-account-settings)  Pricing & Account Settings

What are credits in Lovable?

## [‚Äã](https://docs.lovable.dev/faq\#about-lovable)  About Lovable

What is the difference between Lovable & other AI builders?

People say Lovable has higher quality outputs, ship faster, better at full stack and more.

That‚Äôs kind of the break-down why we would recommend Lovable:

- **Supabase integration**: Lovable just makes it smoother. You connect with an API key and you‚Äôre good to go. No hoops.
- **Image uploads** actually work. Didn‚Äôt have to debug anything.
- **GitHub commits** show up cleanly as external updates. Easy to track changes.
- **Precision edits with the visual editor** ‚Äî it‚Äôs free. You can tweak small UI things without breaking stuff. It just feels like Figma was naturally integrated.
- **‚ÄúTry to fix‚Äù is free**, too. You don‚Äôt get punished for iterating.
- **Chat mode** is way more natural. Feels like pair programming with an actual teammate.
- **UX/UI output** is just better. It looks like something you‚Äôd actually ship.
- **Product output is usable**. You get real controls, working links, multiple pages ‚Äî not just a static playground.
- **Community** is much bigger & more helpful and active.
- **We‚Äôre more ambitious** in terms of what they‚Äôre enabling - product and brand itself.
- **Attention to detail** shows everywhere ‚Äî naming, layouts, error handling.

Other AI builders may still be valid solutions, but [Lovable.dev](http://lovable.dev/) feels more full-stack ready and thoughtful.

What is the difference between Lovable & Cursor?

**Lovable and Cursor are both $20/month tools that help you build software with AI.** But they serve different needs, especially if you‚Äôre just starting out.

Here‚Äôs the simplest way to think about it:

|  | [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/) | Cursor |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Built for | Non-technical creators | Developers |
| What it gives you | Working full-stack web app (UI + Backend + Database) | Smart coding assistant inside your code editor |
| Requires coding | No coding needed | Yes you need to understand code |
| Setup complexity | Minimal - Supabase, Auth, API, deploy are handled for you | You start from scratch and wire everything manually |
| Best for | Building your MVP fast | Customizing and scaling your app |
| Learning curve | Friendly | Steep but powerful |
| Output | Deployed app | Code you need to run yourself |

If you‚Äôre **non-technical** and want to launch your **AI-powered web app** fast ‚Äî [**Lovable**](https://lovable.dev/)\\*\\* is the better choice\*\*. It does the heavy lifting for you:

- Spins up your backend (like Supabase) automatically
- Lets you prompt in plain English
- Deploys your app with one click
- Gives you full code access when you‚Äôre ready to go deeper

> Many builders start with Lovable, then export the code and refine it in Cursor once they‚Äôre more confident.

You don‚Äôt have to choose one forever. Start with Lovable. Grow at your own pace.

Does Lovable have a partner program?

Yes! Join our [Affiliate Program](https://friends.lovable.dev/) and earn 20% commission for customer referrals.

1. The publishing process typically takes less than a minute. You‚Äôll receive a
notification once it‚Äôs complete.
2. We‚Äôve added an option in the project settings to **show or hide the Lovable badge** on your deployed app. You can customize this setting before publishing.

Step 6

**Use previewing for iterative development**

- Previewing is very handy as it allows you and others to view the latest changes without affecting the live, published version of your application.
- We‚Äôve noticed users using it for iterative development and getting real-time feedback, as well as for collaborative reviews and testing before final deployment.

Previewing allows you to **see your latest changes** without affecting the live, published version.

To preview:

1. Open the **Publish** dialog.
2. Locate the **Preview** section.
3. Click the generated **preview link** to view or share your work-in-progress updates.

The preview link is generated instantly and can be shared with team members for feedback.
